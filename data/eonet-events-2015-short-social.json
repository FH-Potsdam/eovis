                    "description": "Raging monsoon floods across India and Pakistan that have killed more than 450 people poured into the plains of eastern Punjab province on Wednesday, sending a major river pouring over its banks and threatening to force hundreds of thousands from their homes.\r\nThe Chenab River overflowed early on Wednesday, threatening the nearby Pakistani district of Jhang in the worst flooding in the region in years.\r\nThousands are now living in makeshift camps, whilst others continue to be evacuated from flood-hit areas.\r\nThe flooding began earlier this month in Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan. \r\nIt caused landslides and submerged much of Srinagar, the main city on the Indian-administered side. \r\nThe water is now rushing out of the mountains of the Himalayan region, affecting communities downstream and threatening to force nearly 700-thousand people from their homes.\r\nThe rains have washed away houses, bridges, communication equipment and crops. \r\nThere are now also health fears for some of the children who were rescued after the floodwaters had hit.\r\nA doctor told Associated Press Television that he had seen children suffering from skin diseases and chest infections after playing in the waters.\r\nIn a statement, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said that rescuers so far had evacuated more than 127-thousand people. \r\nIt said civil authorities and troops were using 15 helicopters and 574 boats to move flood victims to safer places.\r\nThe floods are the worst to hit Pakistan since 2010, when some 1,700 people died. \r\nAuthorities say they have alerted troops in Pakistan's southern Sindh province, where flooding was expected to reach later this week.\r\nMore than 1.5 (m) million people have been affected, with thousands losing their homes to the rising water.\r\nAt least 257 people have died and another 461 have been injured in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the flooding, while 200 have been killed in India, officials say.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2f3379804205fd9d1640dfc1b181cf5d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

                        "description": "Raging monsoon floods across India and Pakistan that have killed more than 450 people poured into the plains of eastern Punjab province on Wednesday, sending a major river pouring over its banks and threatening to force hundreds of thousands from their homes.\r\nThe Chenab River overflowed early on Wednesday, threatening the nearby Pakistani district of Jhang in the worst flooding in the region in years.\r\nThousands are now living in makeshift camps, whilst others continue to be evacuated from flood-hit areas.\r\nThe flooding began earlier this month in Kashmir, which is claimed by both India and Pakistan. \r\nIt caused landslides and submerged much of Srinagar, the main city on the Indian-administered side. \r\nThe water is now rushing out of the mountains of the Himalayan region, affecting communities downstream and threatening to force nearly 700-thousand people from their homes.\r\nThe rains have washed away houses, bridges, communication equipment and crops. \r\nThere are now also health fears for some of the children who were rescued after the floodwaters had hit.\r\nA doctor told Associated Press Television that he had seen children suffering from skin diseases and chest infections after playing in the waters.\r\nIn a statement, Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority said that rescuers so far had evacuated more than 127-thousand people. \r\nIt said civil authorities and troops were using 15 helicopters and 574 boats to move flood victims to safer places.\r\nThe floods are the worst to hit Pakistan since 2010, when some 1,700 people died. \r\nAuthorities say they have alerted troops in Pakistan's southern Sindh province, where flooding was expected to reach later this week.\r\nMore than 1.5 (m) million people have been affected, with thousands losing their homes to the rising water.\r\nAt least 257 people have died and another 461 have been injured in Pakistan and Pakistan-administered Kashmir in the flooding, while 200 have been killed in India, officials say.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2f3379804205fd9d1640dfc1b181cf5d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

Distressed by growing extremism, lack of development and discriminatory policies of Islamabad, the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir want to be a part of India, claimed Moulana Syed Athar Hussain Dehlavi, the chairman of the Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool. Dehlavi, who visited PoK after the devastating floods last year, said people there favour a referendum so that they can vote to join back to India. In September last year, when Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the flood-affected areas of PoK, he was greeted with slogans “Go Nawaz Go”. It reflected the frustration of the people with regard to the apathy of the Pakistan government in dealing with the very critical situation. The people in PoK are fed up with the atrocities committed against them by the Pakistani establishment for decades. The region has always been neglected by Islamabad and used for nurturing terror camps. The people of PoK are shocked after Pakistan signed more than 50 pacts worth an estimated USD 46 billion in infrastructure projects as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The corridor passed through Kashmir, will connect the city of Kashgar in western China with the Pakistani deep sea port of Gwadar.",

Distressed by growing extremism, lack of development and discriminatory policies of Islamabad, the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir want to be a part of India, claimed Moulana Syed Athar Hussain Dehlavi, the chairman of the Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool. Dehlavi, who visited PoK after the devastating floods last year, said people there favour a referendum so that they can vote to join back to India. In September last year, when Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the flood-affected areas of PoK, he was greeted with slogans “Go Nawaz Go”. It reflected the frustration of the people with regard to the apathy of the Pakistan government in dealing with the very critical situation. The people in PoK are fed up with the atrocities committed against them by the Pakistani establishment for decades. The region has always been neglected by Islamabad and used for nurturing terror camps. The people of PoK are shocked after Pakistan signed more than 50 pacts worth an estimated USD 46 billion in infrastructure projects as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The corridor passed through Kashmir, will connect the city of Kashgar in western China with the Pakistani deep sea port of Gwadar."

I am living in misery,\" said one flood victim. \r\nIn southern Pakistan, the river Indus is now more than 15 miles (25 kilometres) wide at some points - 25 times wider than during normal monsoon seasons.\r\nMany flood victims are living in muddy camps or overcrowded government buildings, while thousands more are sleeping in the open next to their cows, goats and whatever possessions they managed to drag with them. \r\nThe UN has appealed for 460 (m) million US dollars to help Pakistan get immediate relief, but officials have said the country will need (b) billions to rebuild after the waters recede.\r\nPakistan was already struggling to battle a violent Islamist militant movement on its soil, and its offensives were considered important to the US goals in the war in neighbouring Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5a1bcdbe7a5149c1b1651c7c9246d756 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

I am living in misery,\" said one flood victim. \r\nIn southern Pakistan, the river Indus is now more than 15 miles (25 kilometres) wide at some points - 25 times wider than during normal monsoon seasons.\r\nMany flood victims are living in muddy camps or overcrowded government buildings, while thousands more are sleeping in the open next to their cows, goats and whatever possessions they managed to drag with them. \r\nThe UN has appealed for 460 (m) million US dollars to help Pakistan get immediate relief, but officials have said the country will need (b) billions to rebuild after the waters recede.\r\nPakistan was already struggling to battle a violent Islamist militant movement on its soil, and its offensives were considered important to the US goals in the war in neighbouring Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5a1bcdbe7a5149c1b1651c7c9246d756 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

Tents in back of luggage truck being taken away from plane\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nChina delivered humanitarian aid worth approximately 1.48 (m) million US dollars to Pakistan on Wednesday to help the victims of Pakistan's flooding.\r\nThe country's aid supplies, which included water filtration equipment, electronic generators, tents and medicines, arrived on Wednesday at the Chaklala Air Base in Rawalpindi.\r\nChinese Ambassador to Pakistan, Liu Jian, said that his country had sent the aid to show its \"solidarity\" with flood victims.\r\n\"Chinese government decided to provide the Pakistani government with humanitarian emergency goods worth 10 million Renminbi,\" he added.\r\nFloodwaters continued ravaging hundreds of villages in Pakistan, destroying homes, soaking crops, and threatening more lives. \r\nAid workers warned that bloated rivers would soon surge into the country's south, prompting more evacuations.\r\nThis year's monsoon season has prompted the worst flooding in Pakistan in living memory and already killed more than 1,500 people. \r\nThe UN scrambled to provide food and other assistance to some 3.2 (m) million affected people in a nation already struggling with an Islamist militancy and a poor economy.\r\nThe loss of farm produce is one reason the UN has warned of serious food shortages, and the World Food Program has estimated that 1.8 (m) million people will need to be fed over the next month.\r\nRescue workers have struggled to deliver aid because of washed-out bridges and roads and downed communication lines.\r\nSeveral foreign countries have stepped in to help, including the United States, which announced on Tuesday that it was sending six large military helicopters from Afghanistan to help with the relief effort.\r\nBut many flood victims have complained that aid is not reaching them fast enough or at all.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7caa74e5c3e8c0a3a9dc19c29ec28a48 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

Wide of flood water in Indus river \r\nSTORYLINE \r\nFlooding in Pakistan has killed more than 800 people in a week, a government official said on Saturday as rescuers struggled to reach marooned victims and some evacuees showed signs of fever, diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases.\r\nThe flooding caused by record-breaking rainfalls caused massive destruction in the past week, especially in the northwest province, where officials said it was the worst deluge since 1929. \r\nThe United Nations estimated on Saturday that some 1 (m) million people nationwide were affected by the disaster, though it didn't specify exactly what that meant.\r\nThe information minister for the northwest province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said reports coming in from various districts across the northwest showed that more than 800 people had died due to the flooding. Many people remain missing.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\nIn Dera Ismail Khan, a military helicopter landed with soldiers bearing relief supplies. \r\nBut Anwar Ullah Khan, a civil defence official, complained that they weren't receiving enough aid. \r\nHe said that there weren't any vehicles available to take injured people to hospital, nor have they received any money to help buy medicine. \r\nA doctor treating evacuees at a small relief camp in Nowshera in the northeast said some had diarrhoea and others had marks appearing on their skin, causing itching. \r\nChildren and the elderly seemed to have the most problems, Mehmood Jaa said.\r\nRescuers were using army helicopters, heavy trucks and boats to try reaching flood-hit areas, the UN said. It reported that thousands of homes and roads were destroyed, and at least 45 bridges across the northwest were damaged.\r\nThe destruction is slowing the rescue effort, said a government official in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, the northwest province.\r\nThe head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said that no more rain was expected in the next few days for the northwest and that floodwaters there were receding. \r\nBut Punjab province in the east, Sindh province in the south, and Pakistan's side of the disputed Kashmir region all could expect a lashing over the next three or four days, he said.\r\nFlooding has already affected some of those regions, with more than 21 people dying in Kashmir. A plane crash that killed 152 people in Islamabad on Wednesday also occurred during stormy weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5f93b4cb3f3fc17630357976069c8491 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

In these circumstances, they believe that in these miserable conditions and in this very acute disturbed problem in Pakistan, in this very difficult situation, if the world come to rescue Pakistan and the Pakistani people come to rescue the affected people, then they can come out of this mess, sir. And if this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world. So they will threaten the people but their capacity and capability is now not that much. And whosoever, the aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security.\"\r\n7. Wide of news conference ending\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nPakistan's government vowed on Friday to protect foreign aid workers against attacks from the Taliban, who have issued a veiled threat against relief organisations helping out in the country's flooding crisis. \r\nThe comments came as hundreds of thousands of people fled floodwaters after the surging River Indus smashed through levees in two places, but many refused to leave the danger zone while others took shelter in an ancient graveyard for Muslim saints.\r\nThe Taliban threat is likely to complicate the massive relief effort, while more than 8 (m) million people are in need of emergency assistance across the country.\r\nThe United Nations, the Pakistani army and a host of other local and international relief groups have been rushing aid workers, medicine, food and water to the affected regions, but are unable to reach many people.\r\nThe Pakistani Taliban on Thursday hinted they might attack the foreign aid workers. The militant network has a history of attacking aid groups, including agencies under the UN umbrella.\r\nMilitant spokesman Azam Tariq said the US and other countries were not really focused on providing aid to flood victims but had other motives he did not specify.\r\nPakistan's information minister promised to protect those who are helping in flood relief efforts. \r\n\"The aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security,\" Qamar Zaman Kaira told reporters. \r\nHe said the Taliban are trying to use the crisis to their advantage. \r\n\"The Taliban are basically threatening the whole nation, the whole world,\" he said. \r\n\"If this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world.\" \r\nHowever, he added that the Taliban's \"capacity and capability\" had been weakened. \r\nThe United States - which has launched scores of missile attacks against militant targets in the far northwest over the last 2 1/2 years - hopes to improve its highly unpopular image in Pakistan through its aid efforts. It has deployed 19 civilian and army helicopters to ferry aid and victims.\r\n\"Our brothers and sisters who live there face this difficult situation,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b25c96209eedd444ef7bcd34b8fe3b16 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

SOUNDBITE: (Urdu) Qamar Zaman Kaira, Pakistan information minister: \r\n\"The lower areas of Sindh province will remain under floodwater for the next two weeks or more. Our brothers and sisters who live there face this difficult situation. You may all know, that the embankment which was around the outskirts of Thatta has broken and it creates difficulties. Some people are being evacuated from there.\" \r\n5. Wide of news conference\r\n6. SOUNDBITE: (English) Qamar Zaman Kaira, Pakistan information minister:\r\n\"The Taliban are basically threatening the whole nation, the whole world. In these circumstances, they believe that in these miserable conditions and in this very acute disturbed problem in Pakistan, in this very difficult situation, if the world come to rescue Pakistan and the Pakistani people come to rescue the affected people, then they can come out of this mess, sir. And if this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world. So they will threaten the people but their capacity and capability is now not that much. And whosoever, the aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security.\"\r\n7. Wide of news conference ending\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nPakistan's government vowed on Friday to protect foreign aid workers against attacks from the Taliban, who have issued a veiled threat against relief organisations helping out in the country's flooding crisis. \r\nThe comments came as hundreds of thousands of people fled floodwaters after the surging River Indus smashed through levees in two places, but many refused to leave the danger zone while others took shelter in an ancient graveyard for Muslim saints.\r\nThe Taliban threat is likely to complicate the massive relief effort, while more than 8 (m) million people are in need of emergency assistance across the country.\r\nThe United Nations, the Pakistani army and a host of other local and international relief groups have been rushing aid workers, medicine, food and water to the affected regions, but are unable to reach many people.\r\nThe Pakistani Taliban on Thursday hinted they might attack the foreign aid workers. The militant network has a history of attacking aid groups, including agencies under the UN umbrella.\r\nMilitant spokesman Azam Tariq said the US and other countries were not really focused on providing aid to flood victims but had other motives he did not specify.\r\nPakistan's information minister promised to protect those who are helping in flood relief efforts. \r\n\"The aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security,\" Qamar Zaman Kaira told reporters. \r\nHe said the Taliban are trying to use the crisis to their advantage. \r\n\"The Taliban are basically threatening the whole nation, the whole world,\" he said. \r\n\"If this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world.\" \r\nHowever, he added that the Taliban's \"capacity and capability\" had been weakened. \r\nThe United States - which has launched scores of missile attacks against militant targets in the far northwest over the last 2 1/2 years - hopes to improve its highly unpopular image in Pakistan through its aid efforts. It has deployed 19 civilian and army helicopters to ferry aid and victims.\r\n\"Our brothers and sisters who live there face this difficult situation,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b25c96209eedd444ef7bcd34b8fe3b16 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

Wide of area under flood water\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nRescue workers struggled on Sunday to save more than 27,000 people still trapped by massive flooding in Pakistan's northwest that has killed over 900 people and destroyed thousands of homes, officials said.\r\nThe effort has been aided by a slackening of the monsoon rains that have caused the worst flooding in decades in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa province. \r\nBut as flood waters have started to recede, authorities have begun to understand the full scale of the disaster.\r\nIn Nowshera city - where water levels were dropping on Sunday - some people were slowly making their way back to their houses.\r\nShair Dad, a timber shop owner, said his business has been badly affected by the floods.\r\n\"I haven't covered my losses in ten years, we are buying this wood on credit, I don't know how I will be able pay it back,\" he said on Sunday.\r\nThe death toll from the flooding has risen to 903 people, said Mujahid Khan, the head of rescue services for the Edhi Foundation, a private charity.\r\nThe worst hit areas have been the districts of Swat and Shangla, where more than 400 people have died, he said.\r\nAuthorities have deployed 43 military helicopters and over 100 boats to try to rescue some 27,300 people still trapped by the floods.       \r\nThe military has deployed 30,000 army troops who had evacuated 19,000 trapped people by Saturday night, said an army spokesman. \r\nBut the scale of the disaster has strained the resources of a government already grappling with a faltering economy and a brutal war against the Taliban.\r\nThe floods have caused an acute shortage of fruits and vegetables in the northwest because many of the hardest hit areas were the key centres of production, officials said.\r\nThe threat of disease loomed as well as some evacuees arrived in temporary camps with fever, diarrhea and skin problems.\r\nA variety of nations and aid organisations have begun to mobilise a response to the flood disaster.\r\nThe US delivered 380,000 food packages, four rescue boats and two water filtration units to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said a spokesman for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.\r\nThe US Embassy in Islamabad has also announced it will provide 12 prefabricated steel bridges to temporarily replace some of the spans damaged by the water.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, Pakistani officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7da343e1357b0bb25d7a3d9571210bcf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of area under flood water\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nRescue workers struggled on Sunday to save more than 27,000 people still trapped by massive flooding in Pakistan's northwest that has killed over 900 people and destroyed thousands of homes, officials said.\r\nThe effort has been aided by a slackening of the monsoon rains that have caused the worst flooding in decades in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa province. \r\nBut as flood waters have started to recede, authorities have begun to understand the full scale of the disaster.\r\nIn Nowshera city - where water levels were dropping on Sunday - some people were slowly making their way back to their houses.\r\nShair Dad, a timber shop owner, said his business has been badly affected by the floods.\r\n\"I haven't covered my losses in ten years, we are buying this wood on credit, I don't know how I will be able pay it back,\" he said on Sunday.\r\nThe death toll from the flooding has risen to 903 people, said Mujahid Khan, the head of rescue services for the Edhi Foundation, a private charity.\r\nThe worst hit areas have been the districts of Swat and Shangla, where more than 400 people have died, he said.\r\nAuthorities have deployed 43 military helicopters and over 100 boats to try to rescue some 27,300 people still trapped by the floods.       \r\nThe military has deployed 30,000 army troops who had evacuated 19,000 trapped people by Saturday night, said an army spokesman. \r\nBut the scale of the disaster has strained the resources of a government already grappling with a faltering economy and a brutal war against the Taliban.\r\nThe floods have caused an acute shortage of fruits and vegetables in the northwest because many of the hardest hit areas were the key centres of production, officials said.\r\nThe threat of disease loomed as well as some evacuees arrived in temporary camps with fever, diarrhea and skin problems.\r\nA variety of nations and aid organisations have begun to mobilise a response to the flood disaster.\r\nThe US delivered 380,000 food packages, four rescue boats and two water filtration units to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said a spokesman for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.\r\nThe US Embassy in Islamabad has also announced it will provide 12 prefabricated steel bridges to temporarily replace some of the spans damaged by the water.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, Pakistani officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7da343e1357b0bb25d7a3d9571210bcf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

If we have updated equipments then we can treat the patients well,\" said \r\nGulzar Hussain, a doctor struggling to run the field hospital at a government technical college in Nowshera, 27 miles east of Peshawar in the country's Northwest.\r\n\"The day before yesterday,\" he said, \"There was a case for delivery (birth) and we didn't have a vehicle here.\"\r\nHowever, he said that although they have treated many cases of diarrhoea, so far they had not identified any cases of cholera.\r\nThe UN High Commission for Refugees said it provides shelter to over 500 families in the Nowshera District and its emergency facility will eventually hold up to 3,000 people affected by the floods. \r\nWorld Health Organisation (WHO) said more than 200 health centres or hospitals across the country had been damaged on destroyed in the floods.\r\nAround 150-thousand people are reported to have joined the mass exodus of the Indus River flood plains on Saturday, as floodwaters continued to rise.\r\nIn the southern Sindh province, 600-thousand people have set-up relief camps as a result of flooding over the past month.\r\nThe waters have washed away houses, roads and crops and smashed key communication and transport infrastructures.\r\nOfficials expect the floodwaters will recede nationwide in the next few days as the last river torrents empty into the Arabian Sea. \r\nThe United Nations Food Programme's Pakistan country director, Wolfgang Herbinger, said on Saturday that the programme needs at least 40 more helicopters to reach the large number of people cut off by the flooding.\r\nThe floods have affected about one-fifth of Pakistan's territory, straining its civilian government as it also struggles against al-Qaida and Taliban violence.\r\nAt least 8 (m) million people are in need of water, shelter or other emergency assistance, making the disaster larger than Pakistan's last two humanitarian crises, the exodus from Swat last year amid an army offensive against the Taliban and the 2005 Kashmir earthquake.\r\nThe country's textile industry is also expected to suffer because of damage to cotton crops.\r\nAlready, the prices of vegetables, meat and dairy products have risen sharply across the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/484d5f38d54e8146a294d690d3fa2cb6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

Wide of children's ward\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs Pakistan's authorities on Monday warned of more flooding to come in the week ahead, flood victims, particularly children, are beginning to contract water-borne diseases.\r\nHundreds of people suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting reported to to the Dera Ismail Khan government hospital in Peshawar on Monday.\r\nMedical staff at the hospital in north west Pakistan said they have limited beds to admit patients, and the priority was sick children.\r\n\"We have treated 100 to 200 patients. Most of them have been discharged, but we are giving treatment to 30 to 50 patients on a daily basis,'' said Doctor Fazal Rehman.\r\nCholera, which can spread rapidly after floods and other disasters, poses a dangerous threat.\r\nThe disease has been detected in the northwest, but there have been only a few reported cases so far.\r\nPakistan's worst floods in recorded history began more than two weeks ago in the mountainous northwest and have spread throughout the country. \r\nSome 20 (m) million people and 160,000 square kilometres (61,776 miles) of land - about one fifth of the country - have been affected.\r\nThe scale of the disaster has raised concerns it could destabilise the country, which is pivotal to US hopes of defeating al-Qaida and the Taliban, has a weak and unpopular government, and an anaemic economy propped up by international assistance.\r\nThe United Nations has appealed for an initial 460 (m) million US dollars to provide relief, of which around 60 percent has been given.\r\nOnce the floods recede, (b) billions more will be needed for reconstruction and getting people back to work in the already-poor nation of 170 (m) million people. \r\nWhile local charities and international agencies have helped hundreds of thousands of people with food, water, shelter and medical treatment, the scale of the disaster has meant that many millions have received little or no assistance. \r\nThe UN has voiced fears that disease in overcrowded and unsanitary relief camps may yet cause more deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d76f34f5c32fa9da1dddb98e24d6d843 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Most of them have been discharged, but we are giving treatment to 30 to 50 patients on a daily basis.''\r\n10. Various of mothers with sick children in ward\r\n11. Wide of children's ward\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs Pakistan's authorities on Monday warned of more flooding to come in the week ahead, flood victims, particularly children, are beginning to contract water-borne diseases.\r\nHundreds of people suffering from diarrhoea and vomiting reported to to the Dera Ismail Khan government hospital in Peshawar on Monday.\r\nMedical staff at the hospital in north west Pakistan said they have limited beds to admit patients, and the priority was sick children.\r\n\"We have treated 100 to 200 patients. Most of them have been discharged, but we are giving treatment to 30 to 50 patients on a daily basis,'' said Doctor Fazal Rehman.\r\nCholera, which can spread rapidly after floods and other disasters, poses a dangerous threat.\r\nThe disease has been detected in the northwest, but there have been only a few reported cases so far.\r\nPakistan's worst floods in recorded history began more than two weeks ago in the mountainous northwest and have spread throughout the country. \r\nSome 20 (m) million people and 160,000 square kilometres (61,776 miles) of land - about one fifth of the country - have been affected.\r\nThe scale of the disaster has raised concerns it could destabilise the country, which is pivotal to US hopes of defeating al-Qaida and the Taliban, has a weak and unpopular government, and an anaemic economy propped up by international assistance.\r\nThe United Nations has appealed for an initial 460 (m) million US dollars to provide relief, of which around 60 percent has been given.\r\nOnce the floods recede, (b) billions more will be needed for reconstruction and getting people back to work in the already-poor nation of 170 (m) million people. \r\nWhile local charities and international agencies have helped hundreds of thousands of people with food, water, shelter and medical treatment, the scale of the disaster has meant that many millions have received little or no assistance. \r\nThe UN has voiced fears that disease in overcrowded and unsanitary relief camps may yet cause more deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d76f34f5c32fa9da1dddb98e24d6d843 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador: \r\n\"For any peaceful solution, non-violent, yes, count us in. If we can mediate, if we can serve as facilitators, count on us. It destroys our soul, the civil war that's been going on for so many decades, the absurd spilling of blood among brothers.\"\r\n3. Cutaway of Correa being interviewed\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador:\r\n\"Ecuador would like a clear answer, a clear apology from President Santos (Colombian President Elect Juan Manuel Santos) as president (Alvaro) Uribe has already done in order to get over this serious incident, because we can't 'try to cover the sun with one finger' and it is not that we look at the past bitterly, we look at the past with outrage. It was very serious what happened on March 1st 2008 and to normalise the relationship (between Colombia and Ecuador) we would like to clear this thing once and for all with a declaration (from the Colombian state) that this will not happen again.\"\r\n5. Cutaway of Correa being interviewed\r\n6. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador:\r\n\"We won't take orders from anybody telling us with whom we can establish relationships or not.\"\r\n(Q: Will you then strengthen the relationship with Iran?)\r\n\"Of course, as we will do with Russia, China, the US, Colombia or Venezuela.... with any country of the world with whom we can have bilateral relations based on mutual respect\"\r\n7. Cutaway of Correa being interviewed\r\n8. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador: \r\n\"We need our own forum to deal with our problems, without the unbalancing presence of the United States. The US is itself, 50 states. And nobody is questioning them being there or the existence of that unbalancing power but we need to discuss our things among equals, discuss realities closer to our realities, shared visions and so on and that's why we need our own institutions to solve the conflicts.\"\r\n26 June, 2010\r\n++QUALITY AS INCOMING++\r\n9.

SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador: \r\n\"For any peaceful solution, non-violent, yes, count us in. If we can mediate, if we can serve as facilitators, count on us. It destroys our soul, the civil war that's been going on for so many decades, the absurd spilling of blood among brothers.\"\r\n3. Cutaway of Correa being interviewed\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador:\r\n\"Ecuador would like a clear answer, a clear apology from President Santos (Colombian President Elect Juan Manuel Santos) as president (Alvaro) Uribe has already done in order to get over this serious incident, because we can't 'try to cover the sun with one finger' and it is not that we look at the past bitterly, we look at the past with outrage. It was very serious what happened on March 1st 2008 and to normalise the relationship (between Colombia and Ecuador) we would like to clear this thing once and for all with a declaration (from the Colombian state) that this will not happen again.\"\r\n5. Cutaway of Correa being interviewed\r\n6. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador:\r\n\"We won't take orders from anybody telling us with whom we can establish relationships or not.\"\r\n(Q: Will you then strengthen the relationship with Iran?)\r\n\"Of course, as we will do with Russia, China, the US, Colombia or Venezuela.... with any country of the world with whom we can have bilateral relations based on mutual respect\"\r\n7. Cutaway of Correa being interviewed\r\n8. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Rafael Correa, President of Ecuador: \r\n\"We need our own forum to deal with our problems, without the unbalancing presence of the United States. The US is itself, 50 states. And nobody is questioning them being there or the existence of that unbalancing power but we need to discuss our things among equals, discuss realities closer to our realities, shared visions and so on and that's why we need our own institutions to solve the conflicts.\"\r\n26 June, 2010\r\n++QUALITY AS INCOMING++\r\n9.

Pull out from statue of Simon Bolivar, hero of independence wars in Latin America, to wide of meeting\r\nSTORYLINE \r\nEcuador's President Rafael Correa has said he would be happy to help mediate an end to Colombia's long-running conflict with leftist rebels, declaring on Friday that the conflict was an \"absurd spilling of blood among brothers.\".\r\nHe also said in an interview with The Associated Press Friday that he'd be pleased to attend the inauguration of Colombian President-elect Juan Manuel Santos next month, despite the fact that diplomatic ties between the two neighbouring countries have not been fully restored and he has not received any formal invitation.\r\nEcuador broke off relations with Colombia after its military crossed into Ecuador in March 2008 and attacked the jungle camp of top Colombian rebel leader Raul Reyes, killing him and 24 others in a pre-dawn raid.\r\nAn Ecuadorean judge last month issued an arrest warrant for Santos, who was Colombia's defence minister at the time.\r\nSantos won the presidency by a landslide last Sunday with 69 percent of the vote. \r\nHe has called the arrest warrant absurd because it was the Colombian state, not him as an individual, which made the cross-border incursion. \r\nHe merely authorised it as defence minister, he said in an interview three days before his election.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d36aacdac49ba07ce54d2933bfdd0d20 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork"

Antonio Rivero, the chief of Venezuela''s emergency agency, said workers on Thursday were continuing to search for dead bodies and human remains at the crash site.\r\n\r\nColombia has grounded the airline that chartered the flight from Martinique while its civil air authority reviewed inspections that the small carrier had been required to perform.\r\n\r\nTeams of French experts travelled to Venezuela to aid in the investigation and help identify victims'' remains, officials said. \r\n\r\nA strong odour of decaying bodies permeated the air outside the medical school morgue in Maracaibo where the bodies were being identified.\r\n\r\nThree refrigerated shipping containers were placed outside for the remains to be loaded once identified.\r\n\r\nThree men and a woman arrived from Martinique at the morgue accompanied by the French consul and hurried inside without speaking to journalists who crowded around them. They were said to be representatives of victims'' families, sent to help identify remains.\r\n\r\nAuthorities in Martinique also are to appoint two investigative judges to determine if anyone bears legal blame.\r\n\r\nVenezuelan investigators were focusing on the possibility of contaminated fuel or some other fuel problem that led both engines to fail simultaneously, said a Venezuelan emergency official.\r\n\r\nPanamanian authorities, however, said they found no evidence of tainted fuel and that the plane had plenty of fuel for the trip.\r\n\r\nThe pilot radioed the nearest airport before the crash, saying both engines had failed, and requested permission for an emergency landing.\r\n\r\nOfficials said the plane apparently fell into a steep descent minutes later.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6cf0d47f99967a3220df73d6598791f6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",
