      "description": "Los Angeles Earthquake Retrofitting - http://cal-quake.com/\nEarthquake retrofit is a structural strengthening procedure which starts at the foundation of the home.\n\nEarthquake retrofit is a process used in building to make your home strong during natural disasters. The aim of doing earthquake retrofit is to make the structure challenging against earthquakes and various seismic activities. Seismic retrofitting is another name for retrofit. Making the building difficult against shakes, vibrations in the ground, movement of the earth etc, is the sole reason you ought to like specialists. Never ever count on unskilled contractors. Instead, contact experienced specialists to have a sigh of relief about the process of earthquake retrofit.\n\nEarthquake retrofitting is carried out to ensure that structures can stand the anxiety and stress of a seismic activity. The constant and occasionally violent shaking of ground from side to side can take a lot of toll on structures. One of the most common methods of retrofitting is to bolt a structure to its foundation. Many a times, the connections in between all-time low of a structure to that with foundation is inadequate and needs to be enhanced. In this manner, the shaking of the foundation will not cause the structure to move off or collapse. Another common technique is strengthening the pony walls or cripple walls.\n\nContact:\nCal-Quake Construction Inc\n636 North Formosa Avenue\nLos Angeles, CA 90036-1943\ntel: 323-931-2969\nfax: 323-933-2301\n\nShare this Los Angeles earthquake retrofitting video:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UQDDlNWssZ8\n\nAdditional Tags:\nEarthquake Retrofitting Los Angeles\nEarthquake Retrofit Los Angeles\nLos Angeles Earthquake Retrofit\nLos Angeles Earthquake Retrofitting\nEarthquake Retrofitting\nEarthquake Retrofit\nEarthquake Certifications",

No damage or injuries were reported.\n\nNo injuries or damages were reported today after a magnitude 4.2 earthquake rattled Michigan and surrounding states shortly after noon.\n\nAn earthquake struck near Dallas on Sunday, shortly after 10:00 a.m. local time. The tremor was centered just southwest of the intersection of Highway 114 and Rochelle Boulevard in nearby Irving, Texas, and had a magnitude of 3.1, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It occurred at a depth of 3.1 miles. \n\nAn earthquake occurred in Michigan this afternoon. The quake, centered nine miles southeast of Kalamazoo, hit at 12:23 PM. It was a magnitude 4.2 quake, which is not capable of causing major damage. However, it was felt here in southeast Michigan.\n\nThere is reason that the word earthquake is currently listed as a trending topic on the net as of Sunday morning, May 3. The USGS is reporting an earthquake of a 3.9 magnitude on the Richter Scale hitting 1km WNW of View Park-Windsor Hills, California on Sunday, at 11:07:18 UTC — or 4:07 a.m. local time — going only 9.9 km deep, which is approximately 6.1 miles deep.",

It measured 6.8 on the moment magnitude scale (USGS), and Mj7.3 on JMA magnitude scale. The tremors lasted for approximately 20 seconds. The focus of the earthquake was located 16 km beneath its epicenter, on the northern end of Awaji Island, 20 km away from the city of Kobe.\n\nApproximately 6,434 people lost their lives about 4,600 of them were from Kobe. Among major cities, Kobe, with its population of 1.5 million, was the closest to the epicenter and hit by the strongest tremors. This was Japan's worst earthquake in the 20th century after the Great Kantō earthquake in 1923, which claimed 140,000 lives. It caused approximately ten trillion yen ($100 billion) in damage, 2.5% of Japan's GDP at the time.",

      "title": "How To Fish Whisker Seeker Rattler Catfish Rigs",
      "description": "Catfish are a sophisticated fish. They’re often perceived as being on the “underbelly” of the fishing world, just bottom dwelling scavengers that explore the depths and eat whatever they can off the bottom.\n\nThis couldn’t be further from the truth and they’re actually very sophisticated fish with senses that are far more advanced than most freshwater fish.\n\nThey’ve got a highly sophisticated sense of hearing. They’ve got a heightened ability to detect vibration. Catfish can detect high frequencies at 13,000 cycles per second.\n\nCatfish even have such a supercharged ability to sense high frequencies they’re used for earthquake detection because they have the ability to sense vibrations that nothing else can.\n\nWe know a lot about catfish but we’ve yet to scratch the surface when it comes to learning how these fish tick and using more advanced techniques for locating and catching catfish.\n\nI’ve spent a lot of time testing theories and new techniques over the past year and one of the things I’ve spent a lot of time on is how catfish respond to sound.\n\nI’ve had incredible results using the Whisker Seeker Tackle rattlers, the X3 Big Bertha Rattler and the XL Rattler and seen some interesting trends. I’ve been using these rattling catfish rigs in many of my recent videos and had lots of questions about them so I wanted to cover some more information on how to fish with the Whisker Seeker Tackle Rattlers.\n\nIn this weeks catfishing video from Catfish Edge I cover all of the details on how to rig with Whisker Seeker Tackle X3 Big Bertha Rattler and the XL Rattler.\n\nThis includes:\n\n-How the WST Rattlers are different than standard float rigs\n-How to rig the X3 Big Bertha and XL Rattler\n-Techniques for fishing the rattling catfish rigs\n-Which rigs to use with different sized baits\n\nPlus more details on how to catch catfish with these catfish lures and how to rig them.\n\nFor more in depth information on how to fish the Whisker Seeker Tackle catfish rigs check out:\n\nhttp://www.catfishedge.com/whisker-seeker-catfish-rigs/\n\nFor more information on drift fishing for catfish check out\n\nDrift Fishing Tips Video:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XYs0RhCr86w\n\nDrift Fishing Tips On Catfish Edge:\n\nhttp://www.catfishedge.com/drift-fishing-catfish-tips/\n\nDrift Socks 101:\n\nhttp://www.catfishedge.com/drift-sock–101/\n\nDrift Fishing For Catfish eBook:\n\nhttp://www.catfishedge.com/drift-fishing/\n\nCheck out my Chad Ferguson Signature Series Catfish Rod from Whisker Seeker Tackle at:\n\nhttp://cfcatfishrod.com\n\nConnect on social media at:\n\nhttp://instagram.com/catchcatfish https://www.facebook.com/catfishedge https://www.twitter.com/catchcatfish https://plus.google.com/b/100005235670931395108/+Catfishedge/",

      "description": "Paul came also to Derbe and to Lystra. And a disciple was there, named Timothy, the son of a Jewish woman who was a believer, but his father was a Greek,\nand he was well spoken of by the brethren who were in Lystra and Iconium.\nPaul wanted this man to go with him; and he took him and circumcised him because of the Jews who were in those parts, for they all knew that his father was a Greek.\nNow while they were passing through the cities, they were delivering the decrees which had been decided upon by the apostles and elders who were in Jerusalem, for them to observe.\nSo the churches were being strengthened in the faith, and were increasing in number daily.\nThey passed through the Phrygian and Galatian region, having been forbidden by the Holy Spirit to speak the word in Asia;\nand after they came to Mysia, they were trying to go into Bithynia, and the Spirit of Jesus did not permit them;\nand passing by Mysia, they came down to Troas.\nA vision appeared to Paul in the night: a man of Macedonia was standing and appealing to him, and saying, \"Come over to Macedonia and help us.\"\nWhen he had seen the vision, immediately we sought to go into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to preach the gospel to them.\nSo putting out to sea from Troas, we ran a straight course to Samothrace, and on the day following to Neapolis;\nand from there to Philippi, which is a leading city of the district of Macedonia, a Roman colony; and we were staying in this city for some days.\nAnd on the Sabbath day we went outside the gate to a riverside, where we were supposing that there would be a place of prayer; and we sat down and began speaking to the women who had assembled.\nA woman named Lydia, from the city of Thyatira, a seller of purple fabrics, a worshiper of God, was listening; and the Lord opened her heart to respond to the things spoken by Paul.\nAnd when she and her household had been baptized, she urged us, saying, \"If you have judged me to be faithful to the Lord, come into my house and stay.\" And she prevailed upon us.\nIt happened that as we were going to the place of prayer, a slave-girl having a spirit of divination met us, who was bringing her masters much profit by fortune-telling.\nFollowing after Paul and us, she kept crying out, saying, \"These men are bond-servants of the Most High God, who are proclaiming to you the way of salvation.\"\nShe continued doing this for many days. But Paul was greatly annoyed, and turned and said to the spirit, \"I command you in the name of Jesus Christ to come out of her!\" And it came out at that very moment.\nBut when her masters saw that their hope of profit was gone, they seized Paul and Silas and dragged them into the market place before the authorities,\nand when they had brought them to the chief magistrates, they said, \"These men are throwing our city into confusion, being Jews,\nand are proclaiming customs which it is not lawful for us to accept or to observe, being Romans.\"\nThe crowd rose up together against them, and the chief magistrates tore their robes off them and proceeded to order them to be beaten with rods.\nWhen they had struck them with many blows, they threw them into prison, commanding the jailer to guard them securely;\nand he, having received such a command, threw them into the inner prison and fastened their feet in the stocks.\nBut about midnight Paul and Silas were praying and singing hymns of praise to God, and the prisoners were listening to them;\nand suddenly there came a great earthquake, so that the foundations of the prison house were shaken; and immediately all the doors were opened and everyone's chains were unfastened.\nWhen the jailer awoke and saw the prison doors opened, he drew his sword and was about to kill himself, supposing that the prisoners had escaped.\nBut Paul cried out with a loud voice, saying, \"Do not harm yourself, for we are all here!\"\nAnd he called for lights and rushed in, and trembling with fear he fell down before Paul and Silas,\nand after he brought them out, he said, \"Sirs, what must I do to be saved?\"\nThey said, \"Believe in the Lord Jesus, and you will be saved, you and your household.\"\nAnd they spoke the word of the Lord to him together with all who were in his house.\nAnd he took them that very hour of the night and washed their wounds, and immediately he was baptized, he and all his household.\n\nwww.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

Vicki had prayed for Shelly often, but this morning was different. The more she thought of her, the more concerned she became. Was Shelly in some sort of danger?\n\nVicki wanted to talk to Shelly about God, but each time it was as if the door had closed. Either Shelly was busy or Shelly's friend had barged in and stopped the conversation. Vicki could tell Shelly was still in shock after the disappearances. Shelly needed the truth. Each time Vicki had called her, she either got the answering machine or someone who said Shelly couldn't talk right now. It would have been easy to give up and talk to people who wanted to hear her message, but Vicki couldn't get Shelly out of her mind. Shelly looked so lost and confused.\n\nShe dialed Shelly's number but hung up before it rang. This is crazy! Her mom will kill me if I wake them up at this hour for nothing.\n\nShe picked up her journal. \"Please God,\" she wrote, \"give me a chance to speak to Shelly about you today.\"\n\nThe Underground, Chs. 1 and 2, Word Power, Deadline Countdown\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

With John's expertise with the publishing program, it looked professionally printed. Readers of the Underground would learn that the Bible predicted the signing of the treaty that coming Monday. Assuming it came off as the paper outlined, readers should be convinced that the writers knew what they were talking about. They would be urged to give their lives to Christ before the beginning of the Tribulation. John and Mark had even included an untraceable Email address where students could write for more information and a Bible study.\n\nThe kids knew the prophecy could also backfire. If Bruce was wrong about the signing of the peace treaty with Israel, their message wouldn't ring true. It was a risk they were willing to take.\n\nThe Underground: Chs. 9 & 10, Fugitives, Betrayed\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

      "description": "Introduction to Thought Field Therapy (TFT) an early treatment utilizing acupressure for the mind and emotions.  The video provides some information on how TFT started and how powerful it is as a treatment for phobias, anxiety, trauma and panic attacks.  This is one of the therapy methods that Steve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT uses to treat people in the Dallas, Plano, Richardson, Texas and DFW area.\n\nVideo Transcript:\nTFT, 2003, www.psychotherapy-center.com\nFirst, I probably need to go back to the work\nof Dr. Roger Callahan who developed a method\ncall all Thought Field Therapy\nTFT was one of the first acupressure\nbased interventions to help people\nalleviate mental and emotional distress.\nin fact all the work talking about today\nmight  neatly fall under the title of\nacupressure for the mind and emotions.\nIn fact this is radically different paradigm\nfor treating mental and\nemotional distress. In traditional therapies,\ncognitive interventions, basically trying to change the way people\nthink about a problem has been utilized.  Behavioral interventions, changing\nthe way one behaves has been utilized, and other techniques as well.\nSteve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT.  But this is a very new\nway of looking at intervening upon mental and emotional distress.\nStart of TFT.  In the late 70s, Dr.\nRoger Callahan was exposed to\nsome work that some chiropractors were doing.  And they had begun to experiment \nwith the use of\nacupuncture, rather than acupuncture, \nactually just a gentle pressure or tapping on the acupuncture point\nrather than using needles, to try to intervene at an\nemotional level. A friend of his invited him to a demonstration\nand he was actually quite impressed with what he saw.\nHe took some training and\nbegin to work on his own then to experiment with and\nexplore the development of a method which\neventually became Thought Field Therapy.\nStory of Mary.  One of the stories that he told when I took\ntraining with him a number of years ago was about\na lady named Mary that he work with.  Mary was an\nindividually who had a tremendous fear of water.\nShe'd had this fear\nwater as long as she could remember.  She did not like\nto bathe in it.  She did not like to look at it.  She didn't like to \ndrink it. She really wanted nothing\nto do water.  Dr. Callahan\ntried cognitive therapy with her, he'd been a cognitive therapist\nfor 40 years and I think he had worked at Albert Ellis's Cognitive therapy \ninstitute in Chicago . But \nhe had attempted cognitive therapy as an intervention\nand that wasn't working.  So\nhe then was trying a behavioral\nintervention system referred to as systematic desensitization.\nIt is a fairly simple idea.  It's a technique in \nwhich one behaviorally, gradually, begins to approach something\nthat they feel a sense of fear about and at the\npoint that the fear begins to rise, they will do some\nrelaxation exercises to try to restore a state of\nrelaxation.  The basic idea is that fear and tension\nand relaxation are mutually exclusive and cannot exist\nat the same place at the same time.  So if you can get a person\nrelaxed enough that can help actually desensitize\ntheir overly\nsensitive response to the object of their fear. He had\ninvited Mary to his home where he had a large swimming pool.\nAnd the protocol was to see how close she could\nwalk toward the swimming pool before\nthat state of fear would begin to\ncome upon her.  Well, he'd never gotten her within\n20 feet of it basically. And it really wasn't going very well\nso he was at his wits end.  And he asked her, he said, \nMary would you be willing to try something\na little different like an experiment.  \nShe said, sure Dr. Callahan, I'd be glad to.  I'll try anything. \nAnd what he asked her to do \nwas to hold an acupressure point. A spot just\nbelow the eyes on the\nupper part of the cheekbone.  And he asked her to\nhold that and to gently tap it while\nshe thought about her fear of water.  She did so, and\nthat went on for a few minutes. And then all of a sudden\nhe reported that she stopped and said that's weird.\nAnd he said what's weird?  And she says, that feeling\nthat I get in my stomach when I feel this fear of \nwater, it's not there.  While Dr. Callahan\nwas thinking about this, she gets up and\nbolts toward the swimming pool.  Now that freaked him out.\nHe thought, oh my gosh, it looks like she's going to jump in.\nHis first thought was, Mary you can't swim stop.  He yelled\nthat out and she just broke down laughing.  She says Dr. Callahan,\nI'm no I can't swim.  I \nhaven't lost my mind, but she said\nI may have lost my fear.  And she went and\nliterally sat down by the pool, and he reported that she dropped\nher feet in and splashed her feet in the pool like a little kid.\nAt that moment she did lose her fear and never had\nanother moment of panic or\nfear or any other phobic responses about water from that point forward.\nSteve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT\n 375 Municipal Drive, Suite 230, Richardson, Texas 75080",

      "description": "Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,\n\"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.\n\"And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.\n\"Again he sent out other slaves saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, \"Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.\"'\n\"But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,\nand the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.\n\"But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.\n\"Then he said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.\n'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.'\n\"Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.\n\"But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,\nand he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless.\n\"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\"For many are called, but few are chosen.\"\nThen the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.\nAnd they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.\n\"Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?\"\nBut Jesus perceived their malice, and said, \"Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?\n\"Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.\" And they brought Him a denarius.\nAnd He said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\"\nThey said to Him, \"Caesar's.\" Then He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.\"\nAnd hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.\nOn that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him,\nasking, \"Teacher, Moses said, 'IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.'\n\"Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother;\nso also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.\n\"Last of all, the woman died.\n\"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.\"\nBut Jesus answered and said to them, \"You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God.\n\"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\n\"But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:\n'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\"\nWhen the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.\nBut when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together.\nOne of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,\n\"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?\"\nAnd He said to him, \" 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'\n\"This is the great and foremost commandment.\n\"The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'\n\"On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.\"\nNow while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:\n\"What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?\" They said to Him, \"The son of David.\"\nHe said to them, \"Then how does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying,\n'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, \"SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET\"'?\n\"If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his son?\"\nNo one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.\"\nNow while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.\nAnd when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,\nand said, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.'\n\"And if this should come to the governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.\"\nAnd they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.\nBut the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.\nWhen they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful.\nAnd Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, \"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.\n\"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,\nteaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\"\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

      "description": "\"Nature in our Backyard: The Trinity River & Great Trinity Forest\"\n\nFine photographic prints by Dan Burkholder, Scot Miller, Jill Skupin Burkholder & R.P. Washburne\n\nJune 25 – August 22, 2015\n\nThe Trinity River and Great Trinity Forest have been receiving much attention, for a variety of reasons, but it’s no secret that the river dominated the spotlight recently. Thousands flocked to its banks to experience the sights of the flood waters. However, the reality is most people know little about the true nature of river and forest as they exist year-round. Sun to Moon Gallery and four talented photographers have worked to change that. For ten years now, the photographers have spent time on and along the river and in and around the forest, including many beautiful but lesser-known areas, creatively interpreting with their cameras. In the process, they have created an ever-expanding and changing body of work that includes engaging new photographs of the flooded Trinity by Scot Miller and R.P. Washburne.\n\nFrom vivid digitally captured images, to stunning detail studies with film and a medium-format camera, to bromoil prints overlaid with color pigments, to 24k Gold Leaf Prints and more; a wide range of subject matter, artistic expression and photographic techniques form the basis of this eye-opening exhibition. Sun to Moon Gallery invites the public to come, be inspired, and see the river, forest and city in a new light!\n\nNew short films by Scot Miller –\n\nScot Miller, a contributor to the “Moment in Nature” videos, broadcast nationally on Emmy Award-winning CBS Sunday Morning, also spent many hours and days over the past months capturing stunning 4k video footage of the river and forest, including many time sequences. He has created several short films, including one featuring the floods, that will be screened in the gallery throughout the exhibition.",

      "description": "It fell into my heart about two weeks ago to write you this letter. I sat down right away to do it but to me it felt superficial, and not really from my heart, so I put it on the back burner until now.\n\nThen I was awakened from sleep and the words began to come to me concerning what I really wanted to say, so I came to jot them down.\n\nI recently watched a video of a shepherdess caring for her sheep... she led them to good pasture where they grazed till their hearts were content. That's what canDEElicious Video Ministry is all about... preparing ground for you to graze on. Come over here the table is spread and the feast of the Lord is going on.\n\nIn the video there were also baby lambs that the shepherdess fed with a milk bottle, reminding me of Jesus' words to Peter, \"Feed My Lambs.\"\n\nAlthough the Lord did not call me to be a shepherd, He made me a hireling to feed His sheep and His  little lambs. With all my heart, I want to do my best and be a worthy vessel for His use. When you watch these videos, I want the Lord to touch your hearts and bring you a sense that He is speaking directly to you.\n\nHeb 4:12 says the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. That's why it sounds like He is speaking directly to you.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nLately, I've been feeling like such a failure at living up to His calling and election. My attitude toward God and misunderstanding His will for my life has left me wanting.\n\nOne of the things that I never want to happen as I teach God's word to others is that I myself would not live up to it through my disobedience and obstinance.\n\nA few years ago, I was so offended with God that I refused to pray. Prayer didn't seem practical because my expectations were not being met. So I weaned off. There were times when the Holy Spirit would unction me to pray and I would kindly decline, \"No thank You.\" I didn't feel mad at God. Prayer just simply felt impractical so I failed to maintain a good prayer life.\n\nBut I woke up one morning the The Temptations fell in my heart and I couldn't shake it... \n\nI can fly like a bird in the sky\nAnd I can buy anything money can buy\nI can turn a river into a raging fire\nI can live forever if I so desire\nUnimportant are all the things I can do\nCause I can't get next to babe\nCan't get next to you.\n\nI felt that I had let my Lord down feeding Him from a long-handled spoon. He was knocking at the door of my heart but my pride kept me at a distance. But I thought it was so sweet that He said with all of His power to do anything He wants to do - the one thing escaping Him was getting me to open up.\n\nJesus said, \"Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.\"\n\nGod's love is poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit but we must first open our hearts to Him and invite Him in (or back in, if He's been pushed aside).\n\nPerhaps today you have decided that you want to get closer to the Lord. Reach out to Him, let Him right the wrongs. He said His grace is sufficient... and He is strong where we are weak.\n\nLet God arise and His enemies be scattered. Submit yourselves to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.\n\nThank you, our Subscribers. We're praying for you and sincerely hoping these Bible teachings are helping you. We'll see you again soon.\n\nMay God bless and keep you and make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you His peace.\n\nBlog: http://richardsonblogger.blogspot.com/",

      "description": "Village Tech Schools, a charter school serving grades pre-K through 12, is in the design stage of their new permanent campus to be located near Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill's historic downtown. WRA Architects of Dallas is designing the school, and Northstar Builders of Coppell has been selected as the Construction Manager, or builder.\n\"We are thrilled to partner with WRA and the City of Cedar Hill on this exciting new project,\" said David Williams, Village Tech's founder and CEO. \"When we're finished, the school will enclose 168,000 square feet in four separate buildings and will serve up to 1,040 students.\"\nThe four structures include a 3-story classroom building for grades 3-12, a preschool for grades PreK-2, a gymnasium and dining building, and \"the Forge.\"\nThe Forge is the heart of the school and embodies Village Tech's educational philosophy. It includes maker spaces, art studios, computer labs, and presentation and demonstration space. This is where students from all grade levels will design and construct projects that relate to and illustrate their curriculum in all core subjects.\nKeith Anderson, AIA, is WRA's director of design and principal-in-charge of the project. He commented, \"Village Tech has a wonderfully innovative approach to education, and working with them on bringing their vision to life on a new campus has been very exciting for our design team.\"\nThe campus will be one of the first projects in the redevelopment of Cedar Hill's urban center and hopes to be a catalyst for further development of this area. The school will hold its \"Home of Tomorrow\" preview of the new campus on the future school site at 100 Carrell Street in Cedar Hill on Saturday, December 12, from 11 am to 2 pm.\nConstruction will start in mid-2016.",

      "description": "Hey followers\nlong time no see and a lot has happened since. Coming back from my hike along the coast of Ecuador I traveled, which usually is not my way of traveling, rather fast. Made my way from central Ecuador to Cartagena on the caribbean cost of Colombia in a bit more than one week. Needless to say that I made my stops in Cali and Armenia where I stayed a long time last year. A sailboat from there was quickly organized and with four other fellow travelers, the captain and two crew member I started a 5 day sailing turn on the evening of November 6 making my way to Panama. First stop after one and a half days on the ocean was the San Blas Archipelago. Geographically Panama, but the Kuna or Cuna people who’re living here in this paradise are independent form the country of Panama and have their own rules and habits including their own language which makes it difficult to start any communication with them. On the 10th I entered the third country on my journey. Panama! And instead of making several stops I went straight to the Isla Boca Brava on the Pacific Coast for a new volunteering job in a Hotel. Next to San Blas another Paradise in this country. Instead of staying there for a couple of weeks, I again ended up staying 3 months painting, serving breakfast and dinner and not to forget, made some christmas cookies and took care of the christmas music in the restaurant during the holiday season and an earthquake inclusive. So nice working a while in Paradise. I called it my Alcatraz of Panama, because I could see the mainland but couldn’t get there! No, it was all but a prison, but there are no grocery stores and no bakeries on the island and getting to the mainland was not impossible but somehow I made it not more than 5 times to the mainland during my stay. Thanks to my boss who once a week got me a supply of Oreo Cookies! On my last night on the Island left another time for the big party in Boca Chica, the fisher village on the mainland. That was also my farewell and Monday last week it was time again to say goodbye to my Boca Brava Family and I left the Island to go to one of the most known tourist spots in Panama. Boquete in the Mountains this time again volunteering in a Hostel. I have to get used to the climate as it is a bit colder than on the coast, but after more than a week I kind of arrived here and might stay again a while at this place. \nNow watch the video and see, how beautiful Panama is and stay tuned, there’s more to see from this beautiful country.\nYours, Carsten",

The northern lake is known as the Laguna Caliente (hot lagoon) and is located in a crater approximately 1.7km wide and 300m deep. It is one of the world's most acidic lakes. The bottom of this lake is covered with a layer of liquid sulphur. Lake Botos, the southern lake, fills an inactive crater which last erupted in 7500BC, and is surrounded by a cloud forest within the Poás Volcano National Park.",

Wide shot above\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nCosta Rica's two main political parties both appeared to be the winners of the country's presidential race on Monday, forcing the first runoff election in more than 50 years.\r\n\r\nAbel Pacheco of the ruling Social Christian Unity Party led Sunday's race with 38-point-5 of the vote, just under the 40 percent needed to become president and avoid a second election April 7.\r\n\r\nThe 68-year-old psychiatrist said he didn't mind a second round.\r\n\r\nStill, he declined to admit complete defeat until every vote had been counted. \r\n\r\nComing in second with 31 percent was Rolando Araya, a 54-year-old former chemical engineer from the opposition National Liberation Party.\r\n\r\nOtton Solis, 48, an economist who broke away from National Liberation a year ago and formed his Citizens' Action Party, came in third with 26-point-3 percent.\r\n\r\nPre-election polls had predicted a near tie between the three candidates, marking the first time in more than a half century that a third party had a viable shot at Costa Rica's presidency.\r\n\r\nSome 200 international observers watched for abnormalities at nearly 1,900 voting places. \r\n\r\nHowever, the only incidents reported were a 4-point-9 earthquake that briefly rattled homes and a small fire at a polling place. Neither disrupted voting.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9e722bf3f8c191e65d2006d622b94aee \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "SHOTLIST\r\n1. Fisherman Chito and crocodile Pocho giving each other a kiss \r\n2. Chito emerging from water near Pocho\r\n3. Chito and Pocho playing in the water UPSOUND (Spanish) \"Pocho, put your foot on my face, and now hit me, hard, come on. No, that was not hard enough, do it again, Hit me hard, really hard!\"\r\n4. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Chito, fisherman:\r\n\"Since I have him...when I found that lizard, he was skinny, really skinny, with a bullet there, a big hole. I took him home, my brother said 'What are you doing bringing that ugly animal here?' and I took him anyway and kept him in the backyard so no one would see him and I start feeding him and he would only eat from me.\"\r\n5. Chito emerging underneath the crocodile and the animal end up resting on his shoulders and back \r\n6. SOUNDBITE (Spanish) Nidia Aguilar, visitor from Costa Rica:\r\n\"It's impressive to see how somebody have such a relationship with an animal\"\r\n7. SOUNDBITE (English) Mare Wilson, US visitor:\r\n\"I've worked all over and I have never seen anything like this\"\r\n8. Various of Chito giving a fish to Pocho as reward after the show \r\n9. Pocho returning to the pond\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nChito and Pocho are a loving but odd couple who have hardly spent a day apart in the past 20 years.\r\nPocho refuses to leave Chito's side no matter what and Chito feels things would not be exactly right without Pocho.\r\nThe odd thing about this relationship is that Chito is a 52 -year- old Costa Rican fisherman and Pocho a deadly 17ft (5.18 metres) crocodile.\r\nChest deep into the water with his 980lb (444 kilogrammes) mate, Chito plays with Pocho exactly in the same way as if it was a dog.\r\nPocho rolls over, wrestles with him, allows Chito to hug him and even give him affectionate kisses.\r\nThe fisherman made friends with the crocodile after finding him with a gunshot wound on the banks of the Parismina river two decades ago. \r\nThe croc had been shot in the left eye by a cattle farmer and was close to death.    \r\nChito enlisted the help of several pals to load the massive reptile into his boat and brought the reptile home. \r\nThe fisherman says he he took care of the crocodile for months, even sleeping next to him at night.\r\nHe also started to play with him.\r\nOnce Pocho recovered from his wound, Chito released him in a lake near his house but he says the animal simply got out again and followed him home. \r\nStill Chito says it took years before he felt that Pocho had bonded with him enough to get up close and play games with the animal.  \r\nFour years ago, Chito showed some of his tricks to friends, including getting the animal to close his eyes on command.\r\nThey were so impressed that they convinced him to go public with a show and the couple have been entertaining visitors ever since.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/710a3682540fbc88c8a730d1cfc1cbac \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "A powerful, magnitude 7.6 earthquake shook Costa Rica and a wide swathe of Central America on Wednesday, collapsing some houses, blocking highways and causing panic, but officials said there were no reports of deaths.\r\nThe United States Geological Survey said the 8:42 a.m. (1442 GMT) quake struck about 38 miles (60 kilometres) from the town of Liberia. \r\nIt was centered about 25 miles (41 kilometres) below the surface. The magnitude initially was estimated at 7.9.\r\nIn the town of Hojancha a few miles (kilometres) from the epicentre, a city official said the quake knocked down some houses and landslides blocked several roads.\r\nA preliminary review revealed some structural damage near the epicentre, but no reports of deaths or injuries, said a geographer with Costa Rica's National Commission of Risk Prevention and Emergency Attention. \r\nHe said a tsunami alert had been called off for Costa Rica.\r\nThe review also uncovered a landslide on the main highway that connects the capital of San Jose to the Pacific coast city of Puntarenas, the geographer said. \r\nHe added there was chaos in San Jose because it was a strong earthquake of long duration.\r\nA school was evacuated in the capital's San Pedro's neighbourhood.\r\nHotels and other structures suffered cracks in walls and saw items knocked off shelves.\r\nA tsunami warning was initially in effect for Costa Rica, Panama and Nicaragua.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/91e31807b1f8b72c6b47bf4d3c310009 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Read the full article here: http://villathoga.com/is-costa-rica-safe/\n\nThousands of people are asking, „Is Costa Rica safe?” Alternatively, could it be risk-free to take a trip to Costa Rica? Of course!\n\nIn the event you act reliably, you will be risk-free. This would mean, do not rest on the beachfront at night. Take care of your purse and papers like passport, ticket, and bankcard. For example, hang the handbag not to the backrest of the stool. Opportunity tends to make thieves, as in any other country. You know what I imply. Therefore, the query is just not how safe is Costa Rica but how accountable you are?\n\nIs the water safe and secure to drink in Costa Rica?\nThe water in Costa Rica is clean and can be utilized to cook, brushing teeth etc. Drinking water you should purchase in the grocery store.\n\nIs Costa Rica Safe for American citizens?\nOf course, I understand if you're planning a getaway to an unknown country that you simply need to find out: is Costa Rica a safe location to visit? I hope I have answered your question, is Costa Rica safe to visit, sufficiently. One more idea: Do not consider your passport or Bankcard to the beach; leave it inside the resort safe. Use a copy of your passport. That is sufficient.\n\nIs it safe to rent a vehicle in Costa Rica?\nIt is easy to lease an auto without any difficulties in Costa Rica. You will need your passport, driver license, and credit card like in your home country. You may reserve the auto on the web before you leave home. It is less expensive than straight to lease in Costa Rica.\n\nOn the following absolutely pay attention: Utilize the seat belt. Be aware of the given speed restrictions. Never ever, drive without a license and passport copy! The penalties for traffic odds are very high in Costa Rica.\n\nIs Tamarindo Costa Rica safe?\nIndeed Tamarindo is risk-free. Keep to our suggestions. Usually do not go to get a stroll at nights on the beach. Take no paperwork towards the seashore. Take just the amount of cash with you that you just need to have. Behave as you do in every other nation.\nIn case you have additional questions, regarding the subject is it safe to holiday in Costa Rica? Do not hesitate to get in touch with us at info @ villathoga.com\n\n#is Costa Rice safe\n#Costa Rice Exchange rate\n#Holidays to Costa Rica\n#Is Costa Rica safe for tourists\n#is it safe to travel to Costa Rica\n#how safe is Costa Rica",

This is her story of triumph, loss, and redemption from hard times - you don't want to miss this!\n\nAt the party, she shared some of her precious bottles of wine with the audience in toast for Robert's birthday. As a non-drinker (this one was so hard not to join in!), I celebrated and gave my appreciation by taking this video of her story. Enjoy!\n\nRead her entire story over on Robert Scoble's channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y4JaXD9pmJM&feature=youtu.be\n\nLIKE, SUBSCRIBE, and COMMENT if you want more!\n\nCheck out Sarah's wines at http://www.sarahfranciswines.com/home/\nFollow Robert Scoble at http://facebook.com/scobleizer\n\nTo see the wine tasting method Robert talks about, see it described by the man himself here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e9CbtnSyRV8",

      "description": "What a weekend!\n \nThe Tech Challenge presented by Cisco is always one of the best weekends of the year at The Tech Museum of Innovation, and this year is no exception. More than 2,000 kids participated in the final event after months of work to perfect their devices. \n \nIf you were here, you saw it all — joy, heartbreak, elation, surprise, relief, satisfaction. Most of all, you were inspired by the extraordinary ingenuity and innovation of our young people, who were asked to design a building to withstand an earthquake. A future in which these kids use their skills to solve the world’s great challenges is a bright one indeed.\n \nMore than 600 volunteers shared their time and expertise with The Tech Challenge team and the student participants. Multiple Silicon Valley companies sponsor the event, including Aruba Networks, SAP, EMC, Intel, the Motorola Solutions Foundation and Samsung. We extend our sincere thanks to each person and organization for their support. \n \nThank you to in particular to Cisco, our Presenting Sponsor for the past five years. The experience these kids have had would not have been possible without you.\n \nAnd we are absolutely thrilled to welcome EMC, our Presenting Sponsor for the next five years. \n \nWe can’t wait to see everyone back in 2016, when The Tech Challenge Takes Flight!",

So three centimetres (1 inch)  per year, if you think if your hair, if you let it grow for 300 years or so, you'd have very long hair. That means the fault wants to slip that much, but it hasn't. We basically have seven metres (7.6 yards) that the fault could slip, wants to slip.  If that's released all at once, we could have a magnitude 8 earthquake. (If that's released) just a little bit: maybe we'll have magnitude 5 or magnitude 6.\"\r\nPasadena, California -27 June 2006\r\n7. Super computer at Caltech (California Institute of Technology)\r\n8.

While there was a flurry of aftershocks following Monday's 6:49 a.m. earthquake, there is only a 10 percent chance that it will be followed by a larger earthquake in the next week, Knudsen said.",

Watch more documentary: http://ouo.io/3zpPb\n[Documentary] .The Great Wall of China is a series of fortifications made of stone, brick, tamped earth, wood, and other materials, generally built along an east-to-west line across the historical northern borders of China to protect the Chinese states and empires against the raids and invasions of the various nomadic groups of the Eurasian Steppe.  [Documentary] .Several walls were being built as early as the 7th century bce; these, later joined together and made bigger and stronger, are now collectively referred to as the Great Wall. Especially famous is the wall built 220–206 bce by Qin Shi Huang, the first Emperor of China. Little of that wall remains. Since then, the Great Wall has on and off been rebuilt, maintained, and enhanced; the majority of the existing wall is from the Ming Dynasty. [Documentary] .\n\n[Documentary] .Other purposes of the Great Wall have included border controls, allowing the imposition of duties on goods transported along the Silk Road, regulation or encouragement of trade and the control of immigration and emigration. [Documentary] . Furthermore, the defensive characteristics of the Great Wall were enhanced by the construction of watch towers, troop barracks, garrison stations, signaling capabilities through the means of smoke or fire, and the fact that the path of the Great Wall also served as a transportation corridor.

The Universe includes planets, stars, galaxies, the contents of intergalactic space, the smallest subatomic particles, and all matter and energy. The observable universe is about 28 billion parsecs (91 billion light-years) in diameter at the present time. The size of the whole Universe is not known and may be infinite. Observations and the development of physical theories have led to inferences about the composition and evolution of the Universe.\n\nThroughout recorded history, cosmologies and cosmogonies, including scientific models, have been proposed to explain observations of the Universe. The earliest quantitative geocentric models were developed by ancient Greek philosophers and Indian philosophers.Over the centuries, more precise astronomical observations led to Nicolaus Copernicus's heliocentric model of the Solar System and Johannes Kepler's improvement on that model with elliptical orbits, which was eventually explained by Isaac Newton's theory of gravity. Further observational improvements led to the realization that the Solar System is located in a galaxy composed of billions of stars, the Milky Way. It was subsequently discovered that our galaxy is just one of many. On the largest scales, it is assumed that the distribution of galaxies is uniform and the same in all directions, meaning that the Universe has neither an edge nor a center. Observations of the distribution of these galaxies and their spectral lines have led to many of the theories of modern physical cosmology. The discovery in the early 20th century that galaxies are systematically redshifted suggested that the Universe is expanding, and the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation suggested that the Universe had a beginning. Finally, observations in the late 1990s indicated the rate of the expansion of the Universe is increasing indicating that the majority of energy is most likely in an unknown form called dark energy. The majority of mass in the universe also appears to exist in an unknown form, called dark matter.\n-------\n\nKeywords Channel:  National Geographic, Documentary, Nature, documentary nature, documentary national geographic, nature documentary, nation nature, nature geographic, National Geographic Documentary. national geographic documentaries, documentaries national geographic, documentaries films, documentaries hd, nature documentaries, watch documentary, watch documentaries, watch documentary films, the universe, universe, universe documentary, space documentary, space exploration, universe documentaries, space documentaries, documentary films hd, documentaries films hd, documentary hd space.\n\n------------\nNote: Video not belong me.

The aquarium had a mini-tsunami and overflowed. We were in the kitchen and got tossed into the counter,\" wrote one commenter on the CBC website.\n\nMany reported feeling a large impact that felt like a truck hitting their homes, while others in Metro Vancouver reported windows rattling and items on walls shaking.\n\n\"I'm about 6 km from the epicentre and it felt like a truck had crashed into my house,\" wrote another commenter.\n\n\"I felt it in the West End here of Vancouver and I looked out my window to see if a truck had hit the side of my building! It was quite a sharp jolt that made my walls bend and creak, but nothing really shook or swayed,\" wrote another.",

We were in Valle Nevado for an early season ski race training camp.  On this day we had the choice of training GS or free skiing pow.  I made the easy decision to rent skis and shred the mountain with the boys, Jimmy Krupka, Tristan Mccutcheon, Jack Despres,  Logan Slattery, Pate Campbell, David Frisk, Declan Mccormick, Johnny Saffo, and Jake Grabowski.  I used the Gopro 3+ with a makeshift pole mount made by rubber banding a mount to my pole along with a few strips of Duct tape.  2 days after this video was taken we had a huge 8.3 earthquake.",

      "description": "5 things you didn’t know about Nikola Tesla\nLike us on Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/FactasticYT\nNumber 1:\n\nIt was widely claimed Nikola Tesla Had A Photographic memory!\n\nWhile his memory was never tested, many claim that Tesla never had to write anything down on a piece of paper. It was later discovered that Tesla actually kept a good amount of notes, but after further inspections, these notes seemed to have no useful scientific knowledge. \n\n\n\nNumber 2:\n\nTesla Loved to make false claims to the media!\n\nWith some claims even now considered facts, Tesla used to love to lie to the newspapers. He was once reported telling the media that he had received Radio Transmission from Mars. He even went further in saying that his technology had the power to communicate with other planets within an instant.\n\n\n\nNumber 3:\n\nTesla was a workaholic who also suffered from insomnia!\n\nHe claimed to only sleep 2 hours a day between 5 and 10 AM. However, this was most likely just another one of Tesla’s false claims given the fact that the Human body is not capable of remaining alive with such a lack of sleep. \n\n\n\nNumber 4:\n\nTesla did not create the first working radio.\n\nThe invention of the modern radio is often associated with being invented by Marconi. However, Tesla claimed that 17 of his patent where used in Marconi’s design for the radio. A later court case fell in favor of Marconi and there has never been any evidence to support that Tesla ever even built a Radio.\n\n\n\nNumber 5:\n\nTesla’s Earthquake Machine\n\nOne of Tesla’s most famous claims was that he built a machine with the power to produce earthquakes. It is rumored that Tesla was working with a resonance device when he decided to try it on his own building, causing his, and several other building in the surrounding area to shake. Worried the device would level the surrounding area, Tesla reportedly smashed it to pieces.\n\nIf you enjoyed this Top 5 video, please leave us some support by giving the video thumbs up.

In the webcast, experts discussed naturally occurring radiation present in the environment to give context to the amount of radiation present since Fukushima.",

SOUNDBITE (English) Robert Murray, Murray Energy Corporation Chairman: \r\n\"We are turning over every stone, working very closely with the federal Mine Safety and Health Administration.

Mid of police officer talking to man in car; car drives away\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nIn Huntington, Utah on Monday, hundreds of rescuers struggled with falling rock and debris in a desperate race to reach six coal miners believed trapped 1,500 feet (457 meters) below ground by a cave-in so powerful that authorities questioned whether it was caused by an earthquake.\r\nAs the rescue stretched into the night, workers were unable to make significant progress and the initial effort was declared a failure.\r\n\"Hope is in order at this point, heavy doses of hope,\" said the Governor of Utah, Jon Huntsman.\r\nMore than 16 hours after the collapse, searchers had been unable to contact the miners and could not say whether they were dead or alive. \r\nIf they survived they could have enough air and water to last several days, according to Robert Murray, chairman of Murray Energy Corporation, which owns the mine.\r\n\"It's quite possible they're alive, and I want to believe that they are, and we're wasting no effort to get to them,\" he said.\r\n\"I take the safety of my employees to bed with me every night, and we will be here on our feet until we get these men out, one way or the other,\" he added.\r\nRescuers planned to spend the night bulldozing a road outside the mine to make way for a drilling rig that can punch holes large enough to improve ventilation and determine whether the men were alive. They also planned to continue drilling from inside and outside the mine.\r\nThe mining crew was believed to be about four miles (6.4 kilometres) from the mine entrance. \r\nAbout a mile (1.5 kilometres) from the mine's entrance, there was an all-day procession of trucks hauling heavy machinery headed toward the site to claw at rock and raw earth.\r\nFederal mine-safety inspectors, who have issued more than 3-hundred citations against the mine since January 2004, were also on hand to help oversee the search.\r\nThe mine is built into a mountain in the rugged Manti-La Sal National Forest, 140 miles (225 kilometres) south of Salt Lake City, in a sparsely populated area.\r\nThe collapse did not appear related to an explosion. \r\nUniversity of Utah seismograph stations recorded seismic waves of 3.9 magnitude around early Monday in the area of the mine, causing speculation that a minor earthquake had caused the cave-in.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/27186329d05cd05e656025a8eeeedd74 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Maybe one day he can remarry and have children again.\"\r\nResident Naomi Fujino was in tears recalling what had happened to her family on March 11 last year.\r\nShe was with her parents when they heard the sirens warning of the tsunami coming.\r\nWith her mother, she escaped to the closest hill and had promised to meet up with her father there.\r\nMother and daughter watched as the giant tsunami swept away their home, praying that the father had escaped.\r\nThey waited all night but he never came to meet them.\r\nTwo months later, with help of DNA testing, his body was found.\r\n\"I wanted to save people but I couldn't. I couldn't even help my father. I cannot keep on crying. What can I do but keep on going,\" Fujino said.\r\nLater on Sunday, memorials will be held in all the locations that were destroyed, and tens of thousands of residents will come together in silent prayer at the exact moment when the earthquake struck, at 14:46 local time.\r\nThe devastating tsunami enveloped the north-eastern coast shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7e846cda2dbe399b0eca08cc87ca6380 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The ceremony was originally scheduled for March 22 with Buffett to attend, but was delayed due to damage caused by the March 11 earthquake disaster.\r\nAt the welcome ceremony held on Monday morning, Buffett was greeted by Tungaloy President Yoshito Uehara, Israeli Ambassador Nissim Ben Shitrit and the Vice Governor of Fukushima prefecture Masao Uchibori.\r\nTungaloy, a maker of cutting tools mainly used in auto and aircraft manufacturing, split from Toshiba through a management buyout in February 2004. It was then acquired by Holland-based IMC (International Metalworking Companies) in November 2008. \r\nBuffett's investment company Berkshire Hathaway holds a majority stake in IMC.\r\nThe new 2-storey plant is a mass-production facility for one of its key toolmaking product, TAC inserts. \r\nThe company says the factory's restoration work from damage caused by the disaster is almost complete, and that the new plant is scheduled to operate at full capacity by the end of this month.\r\nBuffett will tour the new tool factory and hold a news conference later on Monday together with the chairman of the IMC group, Eitan Wertheimer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b1242d1faa88d6ea00c8bfd1b1ddb8b6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Life has been put on hold for most residents of a small Japanese fishing town following the devastating earthquake and tsunami on 11 March.  \r\nThree months after the disaster struck, Minamisanriku in Miyagi Prefecture largely remains flattened, with many complaining of painstakingly slow reconstruction efforts. \r\nRubble still blankets the ground, while residents sit patiently in makeshift tents waiting for their homes to be rebuilt. \r\n\"It's been three months�and I feel that time has frozen since the day of the disaster,\" construction manager Shoji Sato says.\r\nAs post-tsunami Japan strains under the enormous task of rebuilding many towns like Minamisanriku, the sheer extent of the devastation means resources are stretched. \r\nSome residents have tried to use debris lying around to rebuild their homes, including school teacher Yasuaki Yoshida. \r\nOut of a population of 17,666, at least 542 Minamisanriku residents have been confirmed dead and 664 still missing. \r\nOver four thousand people are still scattered in shelters. \r\nOthers have moved themselves into temporary homes or left Minamisanriku to stay with relatives.   \r\nThe port city was once a busy town with supermarkets, shopping centres, banks, offices, schools and over 5-thousand houses.   \r\nThe tsunami swept away nearly every business, every job. \r\nElectricity returned in mid-May, but enough water is only running for washing dirty clothes and flushing toilets.   \r\nThe water contains too much salt to cook, but residents say they take baths in it anyway because that is all they have.    \r\nIkuko Abe lost her home and her livelihood, working in a hair salon, following the disaster. \r\nNow she works everyday as a volunteer making lunch and dinner for people living in an evacuation centre in the town.  \r\n\"How long will it take for us to get back everything that used to exist, like supermarkets, hospitals, the town hall�I have no idea how long it will take for us to get our town back. Probably decades,\" she says wearily.\r\nEvery day, bulldozers organise debris into separate piles; wood to be used as fuel, or piles of scrap metal to be hauled away.    \r\nBut no one knows when the city will get back on its feet and local residents don't appear hopeful about their town's future.\r\n\"I wonder if it will be any different in August,\" says a 92-year-old town resident, now living in temporary housing accomodation.\r\nThe pulverised coast is still being hit by hundreds of small aftershocks each day. \r\nJapan is located on the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines spanning the Pacific Basin, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/63a2c8952cada5979f6ce8f0c6df4150 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of trucks at search operation\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nSirens wailed and people bowed their heads and wept along Japan's devastated northeast coast on Monday as they marked a month since the tsunami that killed up to 25-thousand people and unleashed a persistent nuclear crisis.\r\nIn Kesennuma, among the worst-hit cities in Miyagi prefecture, members of Japan's Self Defence Force carrying out the search operation for the missing, gathered for the moment of silence ceremony at 2:46 p.m., (05:46 GMT) the exact moment of the magnitude-9.0 quake that spawned the tsunami March 11.\r\nAfter an announcement by the city government on a speaker, soldiers and civilians stopped their work and took off their helmets as the noisy clatter of searching equipment ceased briefly.\r\nWith thousands of bodies yet to be found, a tsunami-flooded nuclear power plant still spewing radiation and more than 150-thousand people living in shelters, there was little time for reflection on Japan's worst disaster since World War II.\r\nIn Kesennuma, about 700 are confirmed dead and about 1,400 are still missing, according to city officials.\r\nAbout 600 members of the Self Defence Force continue to search for bodies.\r\n\"It is impossible for us to remove the mass of rubble by just manpower, so we have to use heavy equipment but must do it very carefully. We are trying to retrieve bodies as cleanly as possible,\" Colonel Toshiki Fujioka, Regimental commander said.\r\nThe earthquake and tsunami flattened communities along hundreds of miles (kilometres) of coastline, causing what the government estimates could be as much as 310 (b) billion US dollars in damage. \r\nMore than 158-thousand people are still without electricity and 210-thousand have no running water, although some of that is because of a 7.1-magnitude aftershock that rattled the area last week.\r\nAdding to the misery is radiation spewing from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear complex 140 miles (220 kilometres) northeast of Tokyo, which lost its cooling systems when water from the tsunami washed over it.\r\nGovernment officials have already ordered the 70-thousand to 80-thousand people who live within 12 miles (120 kilometres) to leave.\r\nOn Monday Japan's government said it is urging even more people to evacuate the area with Chief Cabinet Secretary saying that residents of five additional communities, some more than 20 miles (30 kilometres) from the plant, are being urged to leave within a month.\r\nHe said it's not an emergency, but that high radiation levels have been detected in some places and there are concerns about long-term health risks as the crisis drags on.\r\nMeanwhile workers at Fukushima Dai-ichi continue to struggle to remove contaminated water that has prevented them from restoring cooling systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b2a2ec304778f0b847f53eca0a0c997c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide top shot of devastation and debris at Minamisanriku \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nMary Caitlin Churchill is a school teacher in Minamisanriku. She was in a school when the earthquake hit last Friday. She was in the teacher's room, with colleagues, when there was a tsunami warning, and they went out on the field. \r\nThey thought they were safe at the field, but when they saw the water rising and going up the school, they had to run to higher ground, up in the mountains, behind the school. \r\nWhen she was in the mountains, she saw water filling up the fields, cars were floating, car alarms were going off, and the gym next to school was completely destroyed. \r\nShe spent the rest of the day mostly in shock, but also tried to comfort elementary students terrified of what was happening to their home town. \r\n\"It was still terrifying once we got to the top,\" Churchill said and she went on: \"we didn't know if more water was going to come, if there was going to be another tsunami, so we were kind at the highest point that we could get.\" \r\nCanon Purdy was in Minamisanriku to attend a graduation ceremony for some of her former students at Shizugawa Junior High School. \r\nThe school was located on top of a hill and is being used as an evacuation centre whenever a tsunami warning is raised. \r\nShe was in the school when the quake hit. The students went out to the school grounds, and people started coming from the town. They all stayed in the gym.  \r\nTwenty minutes after the warning, she came out to see what was happening and the valley where the town was located had already filled with water. \r\nShe said she was overwhelmed by the experience, which seemed unreal. She never expected to see something like that. Everyone in the gym was shocked, people were worried, but people also immediately tried to get help. \r\n\"It was probably the most devastating thing I've ever seen, and I didn't lose my home, I didn't possibly lose a family member. So it was just overwhelming,\" Purdy said. \r\nIn Minamisanriku, 10-thousand people are still missing, according to a government spokesman. That is nearly two-thirds of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b0ccb9221681f626b0bd66c2515120f8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of cars driving by a damaged car\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nLocal residents in the city of Iwaki were clearing away debris on Sunday, following a devastating tsunami that was unleashed by Japan's biggest recorded earthquake.\r\nThe magnitude-8.9 offshore quake triggered a 23-foot (seven-metre) tsunami and was followed for hours by more than 50 aftershocks, many of them more than magnitude 6.0. \r\nThe powerful tsunami also caused an explosion at one of the country's many nuclear reactors.\r\nThe explosion at the nuclear plant, Fukushima Dai-ichi, 170 miles (274 kilometres) northeast of Tokyo, appeared to be a consequence of steps taken to prevent a meltdown after the quake and tsunami knocked out power to the plant, crippling the system used to cool fuel rods there.\r\nThe Japanese government said radiation emanating from the plant appeared to have decreased after Saturday's blast,\r\nwhich produced a cloud of white smoke that obscured the complex. But the danger was grave enough that officials pumped seawater into the reactor to avoid disaster and moved 170,000 people from the area.\r\nJapan's nuclear safety agency then reported an emergency at another reactor unit, the third in the complex to have its cooling systems malfunction.\r\nMeanwhile teams searched for the missing along hundreds of miles (kilometres) of the Japanese coast, and thousands of hungry\r\nsurvivors huddled in darkened emergency centres that were cut off from rescuers and aid. \r\nAt least a million households had gone without water since the quake struck.  Large areas of the countryside were surrounded by water and unreachable.\r\nThe government said 642 people were missing and 1,426 injured.  But there were grim signs that the death toll could soar. One report said no one could find four whole trains.  Others said 9,500 people in one coastal town were unaccounted for and that at least 200 bodies had washed ashore elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/41ca7791f47d98bad3e2e3b0ea386dd5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of vehicles outside evacuation centre which houses the clinic\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nA clinic in the northeastern Japanese city of Rikuzentakata was full to bursting point on Saturday with patients who need medicine, but that medicine was in short supply. \r\nThe clinic has been set up by the Japanese Red Cross to treat survivors of last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami in which an estimated more than 10-thousand people were killed.\r\nThe port city of Rikuzentakata, was home to 20-thousand people before the disaster.\r\nTetsuro Murakuni, 73, said the clinic has been his lifeline.\r\nHe needs daily medicine for high blood pressure, but the tsunami ruined most of his supply. \r\nMurakuni could not drive to the hospital as there was no gas for his car, and even if there had been, the piles of debris clogging the road would make the journey impossible.\r\n\"This clinic is very helpful for me,\" he said. \r\nTransportation between Tokyo and the tsunami zone has been disrupted, meaning supplies aren't getting to those in need fast enough.\r\nThere are two shelves stocked with various boxes of pills, and two suitcases filled with gauze, syringes and bandages. But there is hardly enough to meet demand.\r\n\"The biggest problem here is shortage of medicine,\" said Dr. Usui Tomomichi, from the Morioka Red Cross Hospital. \r\nTomomichi said it is not just the patients' physical health that is suffering, it is their mental health as well. \r\nDoctors are beginning to see a rise in both depression and anxiety.\r\n\"They've lost their house, they've lost their family members, and they survived somehow,\" said Tomomichi. \r\n\"But they'll think how am I going to live from now on? What has happened to my goals for the future?' They will wonder, 'What's the purpose of my life?'\" \r\nJapan is continuing to grapple with overwhelming consequences of the cascade of disasters caused by a 9.0-magnitude earthquake on March 11.\r\nThe quake caused a tsunami that ravaged Japan's northeastern coast, killing more than 7,200 people and knocking out backup cooling systems at a nuclear plant in Fukushima, which has been leaking radiation.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/80ac999fcac808168293998b51e7efb4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "A symbolic landmark of the Japan's devastating tsunami - a 360-ton (330 metric ton) ship stranded inland - was shown to the media on Saturday for one last time before it is completely dismantled.\r\nIn March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake offshore of northeastern Japan, and the ensuing tsunami, killed more than 18-thousand people and devastated the coastline for hundreds of miles (kilometres).\r\nThe destruction caused by the tsunami came to be symbolised in a handful of iconic landmarks - including the 60 metre-long and 360-ton fishing vessel, the \"No.18 Kyotokumaru.\" \r\nWorkers began dismantling the stranded fishing boat early last month after a citywide vote showed the majority of the residents voted to have the ship destroyed.\r\nA non-profit organisation based in Hokkaido was contracted for the dismantling process. \r\nKazumichi Shimizu, Professor at the Muroran Institute of Technology who heads the non-profit organisation, said the dismantling process had taken longer than expected, but was nearly done.\r\n\"Within a week, most of the dismantling will be complete,\" he said.\r\nShimizu said the biggest task was to separate the large amounts of foam material used for padding in the ship's water tanks, from the scrap metal. \r\nThis will need to be done by hand.\r\nWorkers began the dismantling process last month by first pumping out fuel and oil from the ship, followed by the dismantling of the ship's wheelhouse on the upper deck, cabin interiors, and the engine room, using gas burners to tear the steel apart.\r\nCurrently, large construction cutters are being used to cut away the central section of the ship.\r\nAll this is done behind a 3-metre-high enclosure, built as a safety precaution and in consideration for local residents.\r\nAbout 500 metric tons of scrap metal from the ship will be recycled for various uses within Japan including vehicle parts, Shimizu said.\r\nThe dismantling comes after much debate among the city's residents and government officials over the fate of the \"Kyotokumaru.\"\r\nKesennuma's mayor spent the last two years urging the ship's owners to allow the city to keep the vessel as a memorial for the devastation caused by the tsunami, but neither the ship's owner, nor many of the city's residents agreed.\r\nOpinion on the ship had been so divided it had been put to a vote by the city residents in July. \r\nOf the 14,083 responses, 68 per cent, or 9,622 people, voted to have the ship destroyed. \r\nOnly 16 per cent voted to keep it.\r\nIn light of the results, in August the city announced the vessel would be torn down.\r\nToshiko Chiba, a 73-year-old resident of Kesennuma, had voted to keep the ship, saying the vessel could have served as a reminder for future generations.\r\n\"That tsunami brought such an enormous ship (inland), and so I wished that people could see the sheer strength (of the tsunami),\" she said.\r\nFor now, she keeps a postcard of the \"No.18 Kyotokumaru\" at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/4e00b855e82b762825ef0bbf381ffadd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of fires burning\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs Japan marks the second anniversary of a devastating earthquake and tsunami, residents of one affected city have been reflecting on the scale and complexity of the recovery effort. \r\nThe 11 March 2011 disasters, which were followed by a nuclear catastrophe, left more than 1,000 people dead in Kesennuma in Miyagi prefecture. \r\nOn Monday, a thin blanket of snow covered vast swathes of land in the city where buildings once stood. \r\nMore than 15,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed, forcing survivors to live in temporary accommodation further inland.\r\nDespite the scale of devastation, some residents hope they will be able to move back and rebuild their community - one that made its living from the fishing industry. \r\n\"The size of the community is going to be much smaller, but people who have been working in the fishing industry, the businesses, they know how to do it best here, so I think they'll stay,\" said resident Koushirou Sato.\r\nKenichi Oi, who was born in Kesennuma, runs a fishing company. \r\nThe tsunami washed away his boats in 2011, but he has since bought two new vessels and hopes to get his business up and running once again.  \r\n\"I want to give my very best, somehow, towards the reconstruction of the city,\" he said. \r\nAcross all affected areas, more than 300,000 people are still displaced and virtually no rebuilding has begun.\r\nThe government plans to spend 25 trillion yen (268 billion US dollars) for the entire reconstruction effort. \r\nHowever, less than half of the eight trillion yen (85.7 billion US dollars) allocated so far has been used.\r\nMemorial services are planned on Monday in Tokyo along the battered northeastern coast to mark the moment the magnitude-9.0 quake struck.\r\nIt was the strongest recorded in Japan's history, unleashing the massive tsunami that killed a total of nearly 19,000 people.\r\nSome 160,000 evacuees remain uncertain if they will ever be able to return to abandoned homes around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, where rectors melted down after the tsunami.\r\nOn Monday, about 800 people plan to file a lawsuit against the government and utility owner demanding compensation and that all land and homes be restored to their state before 11 March, 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5b7007344c76a6262d64d9c6707a6c38 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

I was standing outside of my rented car when the quake initially struck and it was nearly impossible to remain standing, but over the next 3-minutes I was able to get back to the car to retrieve my camera and began documenting the shaking.  Without hesitation, I immediately sought a high point as a vertical shelter in case of a tsunami - that decision saved my life!  I documented the resulting tsunami from atop of a hill that overlooked Otsuchi Harbor.  This is a small percentage of the entire video that I recorded.",

This footage was taken in the early morning hours of July 3, 2015 at a distance of about 100 meters after focusing the camera in the crater for more than twelve hours.\n\nClick on the following link to view the complete video: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvYZqc9pPfc\n\nAll images contained in the video are property of Martin Siering.\n\n© www.martinsieringphotography.de\n\nTo view more of my work, please visit my homepage:\n\nwww.martinsieringphotography.de\n\n\nGerman:\nEinzigartige und beindruckende Impressionen mit #dokumentarischen Hintergrund vom #Vulkan „Batu Tara“ (Brennender Stein) auf der Insel #Komba (#Pulau Komba) in der #Flores Sea – Indonesien während einer #Vulkan-Expedition im #Juni/Juli #2015\n\nUnter anderem sind in dieser kurzen Reportage verblüffende Fotos von #strombolianische  #Eruptionen des #Vulkans am Tage und während der Nacht, von der #Milchstraße und dem #Alltag im #Basecamp, kurze #Video-Mitschnitte und noch bisher #einmalige #Zeitraffer-Aufnahmen vom #Batu #Tara Vulkan zu sehen!\n\nEin besonderes Highlight der #Expedition war die Gelegenheit einen #pyroklastischen Strom per Video von nahe festhalten zu können. \nDieser wurde durch eine imposante #Asche-Eruption ausgelöst bei der ein Stück des #Kraterrandes einstürzte, raste anschließend mit ca. #150km/h die #Feuerrutsche hinunter und suchte sich seinen Weg über das offene #Meer! \nNach mehr als 12 Stunden Wartezeit mit #Fokus auf den #Krater, entstand diese Aufnahme als eine der Letzten in den frühen #Morgenstunden des #3.Juli 2015. \nDie Entfernung betrug ca. #100-150m  von meinem Standpunkt aus.\n\nHier der #Link zum #Video zum kompletten #Video: \n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLLZc1zKUt4\noder\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TvYZqc9pPfc\n\nAlle Fotos, Zeitraffer und Videos wurden von mir, Martin Siering, angefertigt.\n\nBesuchen und Entdecken Sie meine #Homepage:\n\n© www.martinsieringphotography.de",

But as a head of state, I am saying he has to face justice.\"\r\n15. Salsinha\r\n16. Ramos-Horta shakes hands with rebels\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE\r\n\r\nA dozen rebels accused in the February assassination attempt on East Timor's President Jose Ramos-Horta surrendered in the capital Dili on Tuesday, including the alleged gunman, who wept and kissed the president's\r\nhand. \r\n\r\nRamos-Horta also shed tears when the suspects were brought before reporters at the Presidential Palace. \r\n\r\nHe welcomed their surrender, which ended a massive manhunt by East Timorese soldiers and international peacekeepers following the February 11 ambush that nearly killed the Nobel Peace Prize laureate.\r\n\r\nIn coordinated attacks on February 11, rebel soldiers ambushed both Ramos-Horta and Prime Minister Xanana Gusmao, who was unscathed. \r\n\r\nRamos-Horta was shot twice in the torso in the attack, which took place near his residence.\r\n\r\nThe 12 men, suspected in both attacks and led by rebel commander Gastau Salsinha, surrendered to authorities\r\non Tuesday and handed over automatic weapons and thousands of rounds of ammunition, said army Lieutenant Fernando Gausege. \r\n\r\nThe detainees were later brought to the Presidential Palace to meet Ramos-Horta, who returned to the country last week after recovering in an Australian hospital from the gunshot wounds.\r\n\r\n\"The gentleman who shot me, I was unarmed, and he knew the efforts I did for two years, the attention I paid to them, always going up to the mountains, to the jungle looking for them, talking with them. He knows what I did to help them and still he shot me in cold blood on February 11,\" Ramos-Horta said.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't shoot a dog, a pig, just for the sake of it, for fun, let alone a human being. But as an individual I forgive him. If today he is hungry, his family is hungry, has no clothing, no shelter, I'll give it to them. But as a head of state I am saying he has to face justice,\" he said.\r\n\r\nThe assassination attempts showed the continuing volatility of East Timor since it declared independence in 2002, following decades of harsh rule by Indonesia and a period of U.N. administration.\r\n\r\nIt is also plagued by regular clashes between government troops and hundreds of mutinous soldiers who said they face discrimination. \r\n\r\nTens of thousands of people fled their homes and still live in squalid tent camps in the capital.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/0b65e571a0c18197aeae5e46cb5dbe95 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

We have only 9 month and we have a significant budget: 315 million.\"\r\n11. Wide of journalists waiting by the exit \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nNobel Peace Prize winner Jose Ramos-Horta was sworn in as East Timor's new prime minister on Monday, and pledged to end the violence that has wracked Asia's newest nation in recent months.\r\nRamos-Horta replaced Mari Alkatiri, who resigned last month after failing to stop the bloodshed and amid allegations he formed a hit squad to terrorise his political opponents.\r\n\"Assisting development in the rural areas, assisting the poor, development of the infrastructures,\" were some of the key priorities Ramos-Horta mentioned after his inauguration at the presidential palace.\r\nHe also stressed that the consolidation of security in Dile \"Our immediate task is to consolidate the security in Dili was a priority in order to restore faith and hope.\r\nRamos-Horta did not mention the allegations against Alkatiri and said he would listen to his advice on governing the country, which remains desperately poor seven years after it voted to break from 24-years of Indonesian rule in U.N.-sponsored ballot.\r\nRamos-Horta, who won the Nobel prize in 1996 for his non-violent resistance to the Indonesian occupation, said the UN should have stayed in the country longer.\r\nEast Timor's crisis began in March when Alkatiri fired 600 soldiers, more than 40 percent of the country's army, after they went on strike complaining of discrimination. \r\nThe decision triggered fighting between the security forces that later spilled over into gang warfare, looting and arson that left 30 people dead.\r\nThe recent violence was the worst to hit the country since 1999. Though it eased with the arrival of 2,700 foreign peacekeepers six weeks ago, isolated incidents still occur and some 150,000 people are living in camps, too scared\r\nto return home.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3594f6dacd6522cb217d3d6d5cdc8338 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Door of office being locked\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nLooters ransacked the prosecutor's office of vast numbers of files in East Timor's capital Dilli on Tuesday as the country dumped it's defence minister and the government showed signs of further unravelling, leaving desperate residents scuffling over scarce food.\r\nMobs on Tuesday torched houses and ransacked government offices, including that of the attorney's general where they succeeded in breaking into the Serious Crimes Unit.\r\nFiles involving all of the most prominent Indonesian defendants in the 1999 massacres that followed the East Timor's bloody vote for independence, including former General Wiranto, were stolen, Attorney General Longuinhos Monteiro told the Associated Press.\r\nGeneral Wiranto, Indonesia's armed forces chief at the time,  was indicted by UN-backed prosecutors for rights abuses in East Timor, a charge he has consistently denied.\r\nThe Attorney General said at least 12 percent of East Timor's entire criminal archive has been taken.\r\nThe stolen material included files, forensic evidence and computer backups, he said. \r\nAsked if massacre files had been specifically targeted in the looting, Monteiro replied: \"We don't know if this was part of an arrangement or just happened.\"\r\nThe Attorney General said he saw this latest incident as East Timor's second struggle.\r\n\"Again that we have to re-write everything in our history - again,\" said Monteiro.\r\nThe setback comes as a week-long crisis engulfing one of the world's and youngest and poorest countries shows little sign of easing.\r\nAt least 27 people were killed in the past week in the tension, spurred by a military rebellion, that has left the capital smouldering from arsonists' fires and hundreds of foreign troops sent to help have failed to secure the city against machete and torch-wielding mobs.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/84660d26eba7d803ec03d335d0cee9e9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Australian soldiers arresting man on street \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThousands of supporters of East Timor's ousted Prime Minister Mari Alkatiri demonstrated in Dili on Thursday amid a huge security presence by foreign peacekeepers.\r\nInternational troops in helicopters, armoured vehicles and on foot escorted a convoy of trucks and buses packed with protesters along a prearranged route through the East Timorese capital.\r\nAn estimated 3,000 people travelled to Dili, many from eastern districts of East Timor, to attend the rally.\r\nThe demonstrators shouted slogans in support of Alkatiri and his ruling Fretilin party. \r\nAlkatiri stepped down on Monday, bowing to pressure from protesters and East Timor's President Xanana Gusmao, who is revered for leading East Timor's resistance to Indonesian occupation until it broke away in 1999.\r\nSome supporters of Gusmao also protested separately, holding a banner reading 'Alkatiri Go To Hell'.\r\nIn a televised statement, Gusmao said citizens had a right to protest but insisted that \"calm\" must prevail.\r\nMany East Timorese say Alkatiri's dismissal of 600 disgruntled soldiers in March was to blame for street battles and gang warfare in Dili that left at least 30 people dead and sent 150,000 fleeing from their homes.\r\nAlkatiri is also battling allegations he formed hit squads to silence his political enemies.\r\nEarlier on Thursday, Gusmao announced early elections. \r\nMember of Parliament Leandro Isac welcomed the announcement saying it would give supporters of Alkatiri and Gusmao the opportunity to face each other through political means.\r\nGusmao has not said whether he intends to invite Alkatiri's party Fretilin to play a role in forming an interim government. \r\nAs the country's largest party, it has the constitutional right to propose a successor to Alkatiri.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9a16a9af9f1858239c8ed61112cb6b2d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The corruption trail can be traced back all the way to Utah to Bob Litchfield and Mitt Romney\n\n I am not violating any copyright laws as I was privileged to this video since I was one of the kids on this video so my parents got a copy. This was filmed in a country that does not have copyright laws as well, if that counts for anything.\n\n If this video breaks any confidentiality well then I staff correct it bitch.  \n\nA lot of the people in this video are no longer with us.

But Nepal was a bit different: A team of Stanford emergency medicine physicians had been there to work with Nepalis to create the first Nepalese ambulance service. The recent earthquake was a proverbial trial by fire for the service, which remains the only functioning ambulance service in the country. In this video, Auerbach shares his observations—and his feelings about what he saw and the people of Nepal.\n\nDiscover more at:\nwww.stanfordhealthcare.org",

Most of all, you were inspired by the extraordinary ingenuity and innovation of our young people, who were asked to design a building to withstand an earthquake. A future in which these kids use their skills to solve the world’s great challenges is a bright one indeed.\n \nMore than 600 volunteers shared their time and expertise with The Tech Challenge team and the student participants. Multiple Silicon Valley companies sponsor the event, including Aruba Networks, SAP, EMC, Intel, the Motorola Solutions Foundation and Samsung. We extend our sincere thanks to each person and organization for their support. \n \nThank you to in particular to Cisco, our Presenting Sponsor for the past five years. The experience these kids have had would not have been possible without you.\n \nAnd we are absolutely thrilled to welcome EMC, our Presenting Sponsor for the next five years. \n \nWe can’t wait to see everyone back in 2016, when The Tech Challenge Takes Flight!",

      "description": "Unique historical pre-disaster and San Francisco earthquake aftermath footage.\n\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck the coast of Northern California at 5:12 a.m. on Wednesday, April 18. Devastating fires broke out in the city that lasted for several days. As a result, about 3,000 people died and over 80% of San Francisco was destroyed.\n\nThe earthquake and resulting fire are remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States alongside the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The death toll from the earthquake and resulting fire remains the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California's history. At the time, 375 deaths were reported. Partly because hundreds of fatalities in Chinatown went ignored and unrecorded, the total number of deaths is still uncertain today, and is estimated to be roughly 3,000 at minimum. Most of the deaths occurred in San Francisco itself, but 189 were reported elsewhere in the Bay Area; nearby cities, such as Santa Rosa and San Jose, also suffered severe damage. Between 227,000 and 300,000 people were left homeless out of a population of about 410,000; half of those who evacuated fled across the bay to Oakland and Berkeley. Newspapers described Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, the Panhandle and the beaches between Ingleside and North Beach as covered with makeshift tents. More than two years later, many of these refugee camps were still in operation.\n\nSF Cable cars\nAndrew Smith Hallidie tested the first cable car at 4 o'clock in the morning, August 2nd, 1873, on Clay Street, in San Francisco. His idea for a steam engine powered - cable driven - rail system was conceived in 1869, after witnessing horses being whipped while they struggled on the wet cobblestones to pull a horsecar up Jackson Street. Hallidie entered into a partnership to form the Clay Street Hill Railroad, which began construction of a cable line on Clay Street in May of 1873. The contract to operate on city streets stated the line must be operational by August 1st. They launched on the 2nd. Even though they were a day late the cable car trials received great approval. Clay Street Hill Railroad began public service on September 1st, 1873. It was a tremendous success. Clay Street Hill Railroad was the sole cable car company for 4 years. A former horsecar company, Sutter Street Railroad, developed its own version of Hallidie's patented system and began cable service in 1877, followed by California Street Cable Railroad -1878, Geary Street, Park & Ocean Railroad -1880, Presidio & Ferries Railroad -1882, Market Street Cable Railway -1883, Ferries & Cliff House Railway -1888, and Omnibus Railroad & Cable Company -1889.\n\nAll totaled San Francisco companies had lay down 53 miles of track stretching from the Ferry Building to the Presidio, to Golden Gate Park, to the Castro, to the Mission.\nApril 18, 1906, the Great Earthquake & Fire devastated the city.\nBy this time the electric streetcar, perfected in1888 by Frank Sprague, had become the vehicle of choice for city transit. It only required half the investment to build and maintain, could reach more areas and was quicker. The cable cars were still able to traverse the steep hills better, so some of the lines were rebuilt. However, as the streetcars improved, even those lines were in jeopardy.\n  \nMarket street, before and after. Dramatic scenes. Horse driven carriages, cable tram. Ferry terminal building.

      "description": "What's #1 here is trying to save LA. The once-Preemie grew up quick. It is Him. Good news is that He is trimming it back to Point Loma only!\n\nCalled to be an oracle in 1986 Roger Hefferan abandoned a hefty political career three weeks after the US attacked Tripoli and Benghazi to keep the U.S. from invading Libya based on CIA Disinformation. Ergo, Washington's \"Watchdog Oracle\"..\n\nAs an oracle he warns California now of the 6-6-6 Beast.  Spirit Mountain was the first to identify the 6-6-6 Beast in conjunction with this upcoming disaster, and just now (1-25-16) they have elevated \"Point Loma\" to a San Diego-wide catastrophe.\n\nUPDATE 2/21/2016, including succinct summary and INDEX to all 24 Posts since May 2015 on the Preemie topic: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reader...\n\nComplete URL ends like this: ...pulse/readers-guide-roger-hefferan\n\nArranged: Christopher Miles, MAGICAL BLEND.\nProduced,: Diana Marie May.\nPress Coverage  beneath Summary in Background on LinkedIn Profile.\nSEE: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hefferan2015\n\nThis 1986 revelation came from accurate non-human sources, i.e. his \"channeling\" of JFK. Whether or not one likes the content of the speech, that the information and the \"speaker\" came through the paranormal is clear. Shamanic means allowed such an altered state to be attained that \"JFK could present his views through me as me.\"\n\n SECRET documents of one aspect went to Paul Rauber,  EAST BAY EXPRESS (beard and glasses) for the June 20, 1986, edition of that weekly (included in Press Coverage), exposing CIA Disinformation. Roger  left job and career to hide with Native Americans to stay out of jail.\n\nFive months later Teddy Kennedy got the Washington Post to run a White House admission that  lies were  planted in the Wall Street Journal, run as\"Truth About Qaddafi\" for a year to justify attack.\n\n\nSTATEMENT BY: Michael Ussery, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Near East Asian, 1985-88:\n\n\"I wrote the plan, and I had moral compunction against trying to topple Qaddafi at almost any price, and so I sent it to Howard Teicher and Dennis Ross at the National Security Council.  They loved it.\n\"Howard decided that he would rewrite it, just edit it really; but one of the edits was Howard didn’t think and didn’t understand the idea of the disinformation messages that we’d bombard into Libya. He added a phrase in there that was disinformation “including through the American media,” including like planting stories in The Wall Street Journal or something like that.\"\n\nhttp://adst.org/2013/04/crossing-qadd...\n\n\nChicago was \"targeted\" with a pseudo-nuke to trigger Invasion Hysteria, as Op. Bouquet following Ops Flower, Daisy & Rose all year.\nPress Coverage: FedEx 10/28; Mayor10/29; El Rukns arrest 10/30; SunTimes 10/31\n\nWHY BRING THIS UP NOW?\nCalifornia must elect an extreme paranormal solution. \n\n\nPOINT LOMA EARTHQUAKE VERY SOON FROM 6-6-6 BEAST BUT  NO DATE FIXED\nThis was avoidable by the Venice Project.\n\nLA EARTHQUAKE +90 DAYS  FROM 6-6-6 BEAST:\nSomething 100x worse would hit LA  but for 2 THINGS: \n[1]  Point Loma will be a wake-up call. \n[2] Even so, \"in full swing\" in 90 days hard because of Yale's Book & Snake\"\nHowever, Spirit does offer to trade 90-days for funding Ocean Saving NGOs.\n\n\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS WITH POLITICAL IMPACT\nIn October 1992 I provided Clinton Texas HQ with GEORGE BUSH::THE SELL-OUT OF AMERICA showing that GHWB \"threw\"​ the 1971 UN vote to admit PRC.\nGHWB \"threw\" the next debate, the Town Hall debate by ripping off his glasses, then studying his wristwatch,  thereby \"throwing\" the  election and hiding the PRC-into-UN vote.\n\nYears later Nixon Tapes confirmed that GHWB \"threw\" the vote. \n\nSEE Nixon Tapes:  12-31-1971, 9:24 p.m., Nixon telephoned GHWB to congratulate him for a successful year at the UN. \n\nLISTEN: GHWB argues: \"Everything but one thing, Sir,\" still faking his FAILURE b/c they slipped up the vote and it got away from him\n\nHEAR NIXON SAY \"No, no, everything.\" CONFIRMING that GHWB threw the UN vote to admit the PRC, since Australia, Britan & Canada voted PRC in..\nhttp://nixontapes.org/presidents.html\n\n\n\nOUTSIDE VERIFICATION OF PSYCHIC INPUT:\n8-8: Project turned over to Edward Cayce's A.R.E., \"Association for Research and Enlightenment\"\n8-10:  A.R.E. \"lacks funding\" to implement it.\n12-11: Nothing further\n\n\nTHE OTHER OVERWHELMING ISSUE:\n\nTypical Bush Disinformation Dynasty response would be to try to label this a hoax,\n\n Hoax disinformation would sabotage the Venice Project, since a HAPPY Walking Parvati was specified by the Holy Ghost.\n\nConfirmation from A.R.E. could have SAVED Point Loma by snuffing possibility of hoax talk\n\nMeantime LA must put together the Venice Project  ASAP.\n\n\n11-17: Timothy E.

      "description": "6915/A: SAN FRANCISCO: WILL THE QUAKE COME?\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is situated on a major geological fault,\r\nand over the past twelve months or so scientists have\r\nbecome increasingly worried by the threat of another\r\nearthquake of the same magnitude that destroyed the\r\ncity back in 1906.  One rather wild notion current in the\r\narea at the moment is that the whole Californian\r\nseaboard could just slide away into the Pacific.  The\r\nscientists are a good deal less pessimistic than that,\r\nbut there does seem to be cause for concern.  We\r\nvisited San Francisco, and nearby Hollister, \"earth\r\nquake capital of the nation\", and interviewed three\r\nscientists:  Karl Steinbrugge, a world authority on\r\nstructural damage caused by earthquakes; Richard\r\nJahns, Dean of Stanford University School of Earth\r\nSciences; and Doctor Don Tocker of the Earth Movement\r\nLaboratories in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/841104b5233f08bbaedc93715db05c59 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "This video report will show the ritual 911 code contained in the recent Shepard Smith, FOX TV media report, regarding a coming major earthquake, that will create a tsunami and impact the North West Coast of California and more.\n\nAt present I still do not want to discuss or speak to anyone, so for those that need someone to explain what is there to see in this ritual code observation,, you will have to catch me at a better time, for I am at present in no quick hurry to talk or willing to explain anything to anyone.\n\nStop the video to ponder the charts if they move too fast and I would tell you that the only reason I did this video, was to affirm for others that this event was in fact a coded 911 future event, that needs to be seen and discussed among yourselves.\n\nThis Shepard - FOX report clearly suggests that 7-23, 7-24 and 7-25 are going to be used in some false flag event.  I reveal this observation, only to re-burden the NWO with their event karma, that is no longer secret or hidden.\n\nThe code is present for all to see and I would hope that you ponder the code and numbers at your leisure.  I am just at present not willing to engage in any discussion, because of my current state of mind.\n\nI am trying to get back on my feet, but it is much harder than I could have imagined.  Thank you all for your patience and understanding.\n\nHeads up.  911 events have been planned and I hope to have exposed their plans based on the disclosure of their coded material fused into the FOX report.\n\nBackground Sources and Links:\nhttp://video.foxnews.com/v/4356513070001/report-mega-quake-could-kill-13000-in-pacific-northwest/?#sp=show-clips\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This video contains copyrighted material.

      "description": "Japan Tsunami 2011 - Tohoku Earthquake Shocking Video\n\nAn erupting volcanic island that is expanding off Japan could trigger a tsunami if its freshly-formed lava slopes collapse into the sea, scientists say.\n\nThe small, but growing, island appeared last year and quickly engulfed the already-existing island of Nishinoshima, around 1000 kilometres south of Tokyo.\n\nIt now covers 1.26 square kilometres.\n\nThe island's craters are currently spewing out 200,000 cubic metres of lava every day - enough to fill 80 Olympic swimming pools - which is accumulating in its east, scientists said.\n\n\"If lava continues to mount on the eastern area, part of the island's slopes could collapse and cause a tsunami,\" warned Fukashi Maeno, assistant professor of the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo.\n\nHe said a rockfall of 12 million cubic metres of lava would generate a one metre tsunami that could travel faster than a bullet train, hitting the island of Chichijima - 130kms away - in around 18 minutes, he said.\n\nChichijima, home to about 2000 people, is the largest island in the Ogasawara archipelago, a wild and remote chain that is administratively part of Tokyo.\n\n\"The ideal way to monitor and avoid a natural disaster is to set up a new tsunami and earthquake detection system near the island, but it's impossible for anyone to land on the island in the current situation,\" Maeno added.\n\nAn official from the Japan Meteorological Agency, which monitors earthquakes and tsunamis, said the agency is watching for any signs of anything untoward.\n\n\"We studied the simulation this morning, and we are thinking of consulting with earthquake prediction experts ... about the probability of this actually happening, and what kind of measures we would be able to take,\" he said.\n\nJapan's northeast was ravaged by a huge tsunami in March 2011, when a massive undersea earthquake sent a wall of water barrelling into the northeast coast, killing more than 18,000 people and wrecking whole towns.\n\nLink Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmGm8PlHnXs",

Black & white footage of ruins of San Francisco following earthquake\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nSirens wailed through the city before dawn in San Francisco on Tuesday marking the moment 100 years earlier when the Great Quake shattered the city, killing thousands as it levelled buildings and touched off fires that burned for days.\r\nA handful of centenarians who survived that devastation joined hundreds of residents for a moment of silence and a memorial ceremony to remember one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history.\r\nMost of the city''s 400,000 residents were still in bed when the magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck at 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906.\r\nThe epicentre was a few miles (kilometres) offshore of the city, but it was felt as far away as Oregon and Nevada. \r\nFrom cracked chimneys, broken gas lines and toppled chemical tanks, fires broke out and swept across the city, burning for days. \r\nRuptured water pipes left firefighters helpless, while families carrying what they could fled to parks that had become makeshift morgues.\r\nOne hundred eleven year old Mildred Morganstein remembers the hardships that befell her family and neighbours immediately following the quake.\r\nBut they disagree over whether people should love the city or leave it.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f80574dcaa53f2994473516cd8dac056 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Businesses in California's wine capital mopped up thousands of dollars in high-end vintages on Monday, after an earthquake caused 1 billion US dollars in damage, according to official estimates.\r\nIn Napa Valley, two hotels and 12 wineries were still closed on Monday, as well as many of the businesses downtown, local officials said, amid a rush to get the tourist hotspot back in shape for the summer's final holiday weekend.\r\nWith the dust still settling from Sunday's magnitude-6.0 quake, centered near the city of Napa, government and tourism officials encouraged visitors to keep flocking to the charming towns, tasting rooms, restaurants and spas that drive the Napa Valley economy.\r\nWhile cleanup will take time and broken water mains remained a problem, they said, the worst damage and disruption was confined to the city's downtown, where a post office, library and a 141-room hotel were among 150 homes and buildings deemed unsafe to occupy.\r\nThe strongest earthquake to hit the San Francisco Bay Area in a quarter of a century also caused several injuries, triggered fires that destroyed or damaged six mobile homes, and ruptured gas lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/a8b54d8ea576ce2eb5864535b135d42f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "A large earthquake rolled through California's northern Bay Area early on Sunday, damaging some buildings, igniting fires, knocking out power to tens of thousands and sending residents running out of their homes in the darkness.\r\nThe 6.0-magnitude quake caused six significant fires, including at four mobile homes, according to a Napa Division Fire official.\r\nThe epicentre of the earthquake that struck Northern California, the strongest in the area in 25 years, was just six miles southwest of Napa, California, the centre of California's winemaking region.\r\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) described the tremor as the largest earthquake to shake the Bay Area since the 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta quake in 1989.\r\nSeveral other smaller fires were reported and firefighting efforts were complicated by broken water mains.\r\nLocal residents counted the cost of the damage on Sunday.\r\n\"All my valuable stuff is in the bedroom so most of everything is gone,\" said 83-year-old Nola Rawlins whose mobile home was destroyed by fire.\r\nWinemakers in California's storied Napa Valley woke up to thousands of broken bottles and barrels as a result of Sunday's earthquake.\r\nThe earthquake couldn't have come at a worse time for the region, which has just started harvesting the 2014 crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c4741cd63ab6e99c0760fc342ff541fb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

This video is of the 10th anniversary party of the new building that replaced the old de Young. It was a free event on Saturday 10/18 that went until 10pm. Milton and I went after Milton got off work. We arrived around 8:30 pm and enjoyed wandering freely through the museum.",

The aquarium had a mini-tsunami and overflowed. We were in the kitchen and got tossed into the counter,\" wrote one commenter on the CBC website.\n\nMany reported feeling a large impact that felt like a truck hitting their homes, while others in Metro Vancouver reported windows rattling and items on walls shaking.\n\n\"I'm about 6 km from the epicentre and it felt like a truck had crashed into my house,\" wrote another commenter.\n\n\"I felt it in the West End here of Vancouver and I looked out my window to see if a truck had hit the side of my building! It was quite a sharp jolt that made my walls bend and creak, but nothing really shook or swayed,\" wrote another.",

      "description": "Cihou Fort or Cihou Battery is a historic fort in Cijin District, Kaohsiung, formerly guarding northern entrance to Kaohsiung Harbor. \n\nFirst fortifications were built in 1720 (during Kangxi's reign and Qing rule). After Japanese expedition in 1874 Chinese authorities constructed a modern fort, which in 1880 had new Armstrong's guns installed. It played no part in the Sino-French War; the fighting in Taiwan took place around Keelung and during blockade French ships did not approach the port.\n\nTaiwan was ceded to Japan according to the Treaty of Shimonoseki in the aftermath of the first Sino-Japanese war. The local troops, however, fought on. On 12 October 1895, escadre commanded by admiral Arichi Shinanojo (cruisers Yoshino, Naniwa, Akitsushima, Yaeyama, Saien (ex Chinese Jiyuan, captured in Weihaiwei) and corvette Hiei) arrived at Kaohsiung and prompted the foreigners to evacuate, as they would conduct the attack on the next day. The foreigners boarded gunboat HMS Tweed and two tugs and withdrew (only to return once the fight was over). At 7 am, 13 October, Japanese ships \"opened fire on the Takow [Kaohsiung] forts at a range of about 6,000 yards. For the first half hour, the forts responded, but after this their guns were silent...The forts fired twenty four rounds, the best shot being from the 8-inch B.L. Armstrong guns in Apes' Hill fort, which struck the water about 500 yards from the Naniwa Kan.\" The Japanese troops seized the forts in early afternoon, suffering no casualties (4 Chinese soldiers were killed).\n\nDuring the Japanese era the fort was not used.\n\nAfter World War II the hill was fortified by Chinese army: light gun and machine gun nests cut in the rock can still be found there.",

Various of flowers\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nTaipei's markets were attracting large crowds ahead of Chinese New Year which starts on 18 February.\r\nMarket stalls were piled high with many different delicacies including dried squid, dried persimmon, smoked pork, and sweets wrapped in colourful papers.\r\n2007 is the year of the pig and a variety of pig decorations and ornaments were also on sale at the markets.\r\n\"I hope the business here goes well. If everyone has good business and we have good business, then all of us can have a happy new year,\" said one vendor, Mr Lin.\r\nOne man looking at the brightly coloured markets stalls said he knew what he wanted to buy.\r\n\"It's cold in Chinese New Year. I am going to buy my dog a red coat so it looks cheerful,\" said Mr Huang.\r\nThe flower market was also popular as people in Taiwan counted down to the New Year.\r\nFlowers are believed to be symbolic of wealth and high positions in one's career and every year families go to the flower market to hunt for the best new year flowers and plants.\r\nIt is traditional for Chinese families to put a blooming plant in their home at New Year and traditional holiday flowers include peach blossoms and orchids.\r\nA three-metre (about ten foot) tall pig made from several thousand chrysanthemums was on display in the middle of the flower market to mark the start of the year of the pig.\r\nThe manager of flower market, Chang Chia-ming said the year of the pig represented \"agricultural and traditional atmospheres\".\r\nThe pig is the last of the 12 animals in the Chinese zodiac. Legend has it that the pig finished last in the race that determined the zodiac's order.\r\nDespite losing the race, the pig symbolises good luck and that inspires many Chinese to have children during a pig year.\r\nChinese fortune tellers say pig years can be turbulent because they are dominated by fire and water, two of the five elements that Chinese mystics say are the basis of the universe.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/76a6d89aec7c51d6c2a359bbf182ae0f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various exteriors of National Council on Physical Fitness and Sports building\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nThere was mixed reaction in Taipei on Tuesday to news that Taiwan has agreed to participate in the 2008 Beijing Olympic torch relay, despite political tensions with Beijing.\r\nWang Wei, vice president of the 2008 Beijing Olympic organising committee, told reporters in Beijing on Monday that both sides have agreed on terms allowing the Olympic torch to pass through Taiwan. \r\nHe gave no further details, but said the torch relay route would be announced on Thursday. \r\nIt is expected to be approved by the International Olympic Committee's executive board, which is meeting in Beijing this week.\r\nThe chairman of Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council which handles policy toward China, declined to confirm the deal, saying the torch route was still under discussion. \r\nOn Tuesday, Wang Shu-hui a Legislator for the Democratic Progressive Party told the Associated Press the Olympic torch route was an effort by Beijing to undermine Taiwan's sovereignty. \r\n\"If the route is from Beijing to Taiwan then back to Beijing or other places, I think Beijing is using this time (during the Olympics) to publicise that Taiwan is one of China's provinces. That would undermine Taiwan as a (sovereign) country,\" said Wang.  \r\nBut public opinion in Taipei was divided. \r\nSome residents like, Law, saw the torch route as a \"friendly (gesture by China and) breakthrough in terms of politics regarding two sides on the Taiwan Strait.\" \r\nWhile others resented the fact that the Olympics were being politicised. \r\n\"There is no need to think too much (about this). Nowadays a lot of political matters are turned into a political show. It is just too much. This is not necessarily a political matter, it is a big sporting event,\" said Huang, another resident.  \r\nTaiwan, a self-ruled island, is reported to have rejected a proposal under which the torch would enter Taiwan from Japan, South Korea or another Asian nation, and would depart to Hong Kong, which is part of China.\r\nReports suggest Taiwan may want the torch to enter and leave through two Asian nations - neither of them China.\r\nTaiwan split from the mainland in 1949, although China still claims it is part of Chinese territory.\r\nThe torch route next year is also expected to reach the top of Mount Everest, although some environmentalists have opposed the trip through Tibet.\r\nFor China, the torch relay route could be used to underscore Chinese claims to Tibet - a Himalayan region under Beijing's control since 1950 - and Taiwan.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/52e7745f47115dc2398e87295de5ad4c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Woman dancing and waving feathers\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nTaiwan substituted folk dancers for soldiers on Friday as President Ma Ying-jeou observed the island's National Day with calls for peace with rival China and courage in overcoming the global financial crisis.\r\nMa's remarks - delivered in front of the ornate presidential office building in perfect late-summer weather - contrasted with the martial tone of last year's National Day celebrations led by Chen Shui-bian, his pro-independence predecessor.\r\nAt Chen's insistence, Taiwan mounted a large-scale military parade - Taiwan's first on National Day since 1991 - using streaking jet fighters and modern armoured vehicles to underscore the island's readiness to beat back a possible invasion from China, from which it split amid civil war in 1949.\r\nBut this year the expansive presidential office plaza was dominated by folk dancers and acrobats, reflecting Ma's insistence that if his policies of seeking reconciliation with Beijing are carried out, an invasion will not occur.\r\nAddressing a crowd of beaming dignitaries and an island-wide television audience, Ma said his efforts to alleviate tensions across the 100-mile (160 kilometre) wide Taiwan Strait would hopefully \"create a win-win situation for Taiwan, mainland China, and the world community.\" \r\nMa also addressed the growing international financial crisis, which constitutes a grave threat to Taiwan's export-based economy because it threatens reduced orders for Taiwanese goods from customers in North America, Europe and Asia.\r\nMinimising the crisis' dangers, Ma said it offered the island a chance to further consolidate its democratic system and high-tech economic infrastructure.\r\nTaiwan's national day, which follows China's by nine days, marks the 1911 Nationalist revolt that toppled the imperial Qing dynasty to establish China's first republic.\r\nThe Nationalists were later defeated by Communist forces in 1949 and driven to Taiwan.\r\nDespite relief that Chen is out of office and a relatively sympathetic, anti-independence figure has replaced him, Chinese leaders still hew to their traditional position that Taiwan is part of the mainland.\r\nNor have they renounced their repeated threats to attack if Taiwan ever moves to make its 59-year break with the mainland permanent.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b935b359894829bb04ae8e64b6b74010 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide shot of Lee shaking hands with reporter\r\n\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\n\r\nFormer Taiwanese President Lee Teng-hui said on Wednesday that the island's new leader will tread cautiously in dealing with rival China, despite pressure from some in his party to engage Beijing without delay.\r\n\r\nLee's comments came as Chairman Wu Poh-hsiung of Taiwan's ruling Nationalist Party was meeting in Beijing with Chinese President Hu Jintao.\r\n\r\nThe meeting heightened expectations that the new Taiwanese President Ma Ying-jeou might be ready to preside over a rapid improvement in political relations between the sides, which split amid civil war in 1949.\r\n\r\nMa took office last week.\r\n\r\nBut in an interview with The Associated Press at his Taipei home, Lee said Ma had the ability to withstand pressure from Nationalist hard-liners and would uphold his promise not to discuss unification during his presidency.\r\n\r\nChina still claims Taiwan as part of its territory, and has pledged to unify with the island of 23 million people - by force if necessary, by persuasion if possible.\r\n\r\n\"Regarding the relation between Ma Ying-jeou and China, the relation between Taiwan and China, Ma hopes to maintain a peaceful environment. He doesn't want any disputes. It is because Taiwan suffered a big loss over the past eight years under the rule of Democratic Progressive Party,\" Lee said.\r\n\r\nHe added that he didn't think Taiwan was an urgent priority for Chinese president Hu Jintao, who he believes is more focussed on dealing with internal issues such as the widespread Tibetan uprising in March and the recent earthquake in Sichuan province.\r\n\r\n\"My opinion on Hu Jintao is that he finds it is more important to settle the internal disturbance recently in China. It's not necessary to mention everyday that Taiwan is part of mainland China. He is very careful on this.\"\r\n\r\nDiscussing Wednesday's meeting in Beijing between Hu and Wu, Lee said progress between Taiwan and China could only come when they employ government-to-government contact, rather than meetings between representatives of their ruling parties.\r\n\r\n\"The platform for talk between Taiwan and China cannot be conducted in two channels.

Pan of venue, Ma leaving\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nThere is no haste for the leaders of Taiwan and mainland China to meet at the moment, said the new president of Taiwan in a press conference on Wednesday to the foreign media in Taiwan's capital, Taipei. \r\n\r\nMa Ying-jeou, who was a Nationalist Party chairman before he took office as Taiwan's president on Tuesday, reiterated his position that there is no urgency to meet the Chinese leader Hu Jintao at this stage.\r\n\r\n\"Resume the negotiations between the two organisations that represent respectively mainland China and Taiwan; if we can do that, many issues, many problems can be solved over there. (Or) would gradually move to other areas,\" said Ma, referring to Taiwan's Strait Exchange Foundation (SEF) and China's Association for Relations Across the Taiwan Straits (ARATS).\r\n\r\nThe Straits Exchange Foundation is a quasi-governmental body that has held talks in the past with a Chinese counterpart. \r\n\r\nThe recent visit of SEF chairman Chiang Pin-kung and the coming visit of the Nationalist Party chairman Wu Poh-hsiung, have raised expectations of a resumption of dialogue between the foundation and China's ARATS, after a decade-long break during the presidency of Chen Shui-bian.\r\n\r\n\"Now we are in power. So Mr Wu (Wu Poh-hsiung, Nationalist Party chairman) wants to resume the contact. I welcome that because the party-to-party contact could serve as a second track for cross-Strait relations,\" said Ma. \r\n\r\nChina already has started pursuing relations with Ma's party. \r\n\r\nLate last month, Hu met with Lien Chan, honorary chairman of the party, in Beijing and talked of \"laying aside disputes.\" \r\n\r\nA visit by Lien in 2005 was the first by a Nationalist Party chairman since the Nationalists fled the mainland in 1949.\r\n\r\nMa emphasised that he urges Beijing to seek reconciliation with Taiwan in \"the international arena\" - a clear reference to the often costly competition to win diplomatic recognition from countries around the world.\r\n\r\n\"It is also in an interest of the Chinese mainland. If they continue to squeeze us, obviously the people of Taiwan will not have a positive image of the mainland,\" Ma said at the news conference. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Ma praised mainland China for its transparency in handling the Sichuan earthquake and said Taiwan would share its experience from an earthquake which hit Taiwan in 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9d9f2db6ea3b0987b8085a4593283eb0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

And now we can't find food. We can't eat rice\", she said. \r\n\r\nChina's government has been clamouring to get aid to the thousands affected by Monday's earthquake. But the scale of the destruction has been so huge that despite the government's best efforts, help isn't reaching victims in time.\r\n\r\n\"The government haven't come here yet. There is nobody asking about us. No one cares about our food and water,\" Li Xinzhi, another farmer who lost his home told AP Television. \r\n\r\nChina's earthquake death toll jumped to nearly 20-thousand, with over 12-thousand deaths in Sichuan province alone. Tens of thousands more are missing, and thousands more have been displaced.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c39daae2effcc47b1565677c9922d25f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide shot of meeting\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE\r\n\r\nSupporters of formal independence for Taiwan gathered near the presidential office in Taipei on Thursday to raise a flag and mark what they call the island's day of independence from Japan and rival China. \r\n\r\nThe activists chose 8 September because it is the anniversary of the 1951 San Francisco Treaty, in which Japan gave up its territorial claim over Taiwan. \r\n\r\nJapan ruled the island from 1895 to 1945. \r\n\r\nChina's Nationalists then took over, and retreated from mainland China to Taiwan in 1949 as they were losing a civil war with the Communists.\r\n\r\nThe Communist government in Beijing still claims sovereignty over self-ruled Taiwan. \r\n\r\nIn March, China's legislature passed a law authorising an attack against the island if it moved toward formal independence. \r\n\r\nMore than a thousand independence supporters chanted songs and prayed as the blue, white and green flag slowly rose above a stage erected on the main road leading to Taipei's presidential office building. \r\n\r\nThe flag has a red sun in the middle with the Chinese characters for \"Taiwan Nation.\" \r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, PFP (People First Party) leader James Soong met the new Nationalist (KMT) leader Ma Ying-jeou to discuss cross strait issues and defence issues.\r\n\r\nSoong has made it clear that he favours blocking a massive purchase of US arms supported by the government of President Chen Shui-bian.\r\n\r\nThe PFP is the junior partner in an opposition coalition that for more than a year has used its slim legislative majority to hold up a special appropriation for the arms purchase, saying it would spark an arms race with rival China that would bankrupt Taiwan.\r\n\r\nThe Nationalists and PFP favour Taiwan's eventual unification with mainland China.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f157bcd967044d74d9c4a17d0d97cd1c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

With the spire in place, it will be 508 meter, which will be the tallest structure in the world.\"\r\n25. Tilt up building\r\n26. Exterior shot of the building\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nTaiwanese politicians and other high ranking figures attended a ceremony in Taipei on Tuesday to celebrate the placement of a steel beam on the top floor of, what officials say, will be the world's tallest building when completed next year. \r\n\r\nTaiwanese President Chen Shui-Bian and Taipei city mayor, Ma Ing-Jeou both signed the golden beam before it was positioned on the 101st floor of the 446.4 meter building (14,731 feet).\r\n\r\nA 50 meter spire will be placed on top of the building later this year, and the structure will stand at 508 meters, when it is completed in April 2004, making it the world's highest building. \r\n\r\nBut there have been concerns over the safety of the structure, given Taiwan's geographical position on two shifting tectonic plates. \r\n\r\nIn 2002, two cranes on top of the unfinished building fell during an earthquake, killing five workers. \r\n\r\nOfficials said the tremor may have loosened the screws binding the the cranes, causing them to fall. \r\n\r\nThe country is hit by thousands of earthquakes each year, although most of them are centred deep under the sea and cause little, or no damage. \r\n\r\nHowever, a quake of a magnitude 7.6 killed 2378 people and destroyed more than 40,000 homes in the September of 1999.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/e8099832e49966a8a18c8542daae2144 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide shot of leaning building\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nTwo moderate earthquakes have shaken eastern Taiwan and triggered landslides the day after a powerful tremor killed five construction workers in a high-rise building.\r\n\r\nThe quakes, of magnitudes 4.8 and 4.5 on the Richter scale, were centred at sea about 10 kilometres (six miles) off Ilan, a coastal town 150 kilometres (90 miles) southeast of the capital Taipei, the Central Weather Bureau said.\r\n\r\nThe quakes were among more than 100 aftershocks registered following Sunday's tremor that registered a magnitude of 6.8.\r\n\r\nThe five workers were killed on Sunday when two cranes fell from the 60th floor of a high-rise building under construction.\r\n\r\nDebris falling from the building injured about 10 people and smashed several cars.\r\n\r\nAlso affected was an old four-storey building in downtown Taipei which partially collapsed and is tilting towards the street.\r\n\r\nRescue workers pulled out seven people, including three children, from the building. \r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Taiwan Stock Exchange reacted calmly to the disaster, falling less than one per cent on opening, but rising quickly.\r\n\r\nTremors frequently shake Taiwan, but most cause little or no damage.\r\n\r\nAn earthquake with a magnitude of 7.6 in September 1999 killed 2-thousand-378 people and destroyed more than 40-thousand homes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7dd2301458ac7abe2f7750f0f5641b74 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Officials at a Taiwan zoo on Monday held a special birthday gathering for their rare Japanese red-crowned crane, \"Mr Big.\"\r\nStaff at Taipei Zoo celebrated Mr Big's tenth birthday with cake, music and entertainers dressed in crane costumes.  \r\nOblivious to all the fuss, Mr Big stood calmly in his nearby cage tending to his feathers and standing on one leg.\r\nStudents from an elementary school near Taipei played Happy Birthday on their harmonicas to mark the occasion, while zoo officials handed round slices of birthday cake on Mr Big's behalf.\r\nA businessman from a local supermarket, Big City, donated the cake for the party. He said he wanted to promote better knowledge of the rare bird amongst the Taiwanese people, to help protect the species.\r\nLocal nursery children also took an afternoon off and enjoyed the cake and music.\r\nJapan sent a pair of endangered red-crowned cranes from Kushiro Zoo to Taiwan to thank them for the relief efforts they provided after the devastating earthquake and tsunami last year (2011). \r\nJapan has around 900 red-crowned cranes left, more than any other country.\r\nThe birds are native to northeast Asia but were hunted to near extinction for their feathers by the beginning of the 20th century.  \r\nCranes are considered a symbol of longevity and represent good luck in both China and Japan.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/522984eac5b16fe974ce5a4374bdc86f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Mid of police standing in front of the parliament building facing the protesters\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nTaiwanese lawmakers broke out in a brawl for a second time on Friday afternoon, ahead of an expected vote authorising a referendum on whether to go ahead with the construction of a nuclear power plant. \r\nAssembled media looked on from the gallery, as lawmakers were seen pushing, shoving and hurling water bottles at each other.\r\nFriday's fracas pitted the pro-referendum forces of President Ma Ying-jeou's ruling Nationalist Party against strongly anti-nuclear forces affiliated with the main opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP).\r\nThe lawmakers had exchanged punches and thrown water at each other earlier in the day ahead of the vote.\r\nThe DPP has long opposed nuclear power generation in Taiwan on safety grounds, particularly given the high incidence of earthquakes on the island.\r\nThose concerns became pronounced in the wake of the Fukushima nuclear disaster in Japan in 2011.\r\nThe construction of Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant began in 1997, but was halted while the DPP was in power between 2000 and 2008.\r\nWith a large Nationalist majority in the 113-seat legislature, the referendum bill is expected to pass.\r\nAnti-nuclear sentiment in Taiwan is high, polls suggest that any public referendum would have a hard time passing.\r\nWhile lawmakers brawled inside parliament in Taipei, demonstrators held a peaceful protest against the proposal to complete Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant.\r\nThe protesters sat in a line and in between the riot police guarding parliament, singing songs in protest.\r\n\"The ruling party should stop damaging our land,\" said protester, Lin Chi-sheng.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3ec5478ad21dc342b7c84eaa36396b79 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of pipes connected to the reactor vessel\r\nFILE: Taipei - 9 March 2013\r\n14. Various of anti-nuclear protest march\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nForeign press on Tuesday were given rare access to Taiwan's new 10 billion US dollar nuclear power plant, nearing completion amid rising concerns over its safety.\r\nThe tour, organised by the builder and operator of the facility Taiwan Power Co.,  is seen as an effort to allay safety concerns and push an original plan to begin operations in two years time.  \r\nAnti-nuclear sentiment has prevailed in Taiwan following Japan's 2011 nuclear disaster. \r\nCritics of the plan have demanded that the government stops Taiwan's fourth nuclear power plant, which is located on the country's earthquake prone coastline. \r\nAt Tuesday's press tour, Taiwan Power explained how it would avoid problems in the event of an earthquake.\r\nThe company said it would build tsunami dykes as high as 14. 5 meters and stressed the facility building could resist a magnitude 7 earthquake.\r\nHowever, nuclear expert Professor He Li-wei of the National Central University, cast doubt over the facility's ability to deal with a real time natural disaster.   \r\nHe questioned whether smaller parts such as pipes and cables could also stand intact.  If they buckled it could result in the malfunction of the facility leading to a possible nuclear accident.  \r\n\"Just like the Fukushima incident, the water system can be washed away by a tsunami,\" he said. \r\n\"Even though the Japanese fire department tried to pump water into the reactor, all the pipes were damaged so it was a big problem,\" the expert added.\r\nThe government objects to public concern saying halting the project could lead to electricity shortages.   \r\nIt has, nonetheless, asked Tai Power Co., the government backed operator of the nuclear plants, to carry out an evaluation test, inviting foreign experts to work on it, and has proposed a public referendum on the issue.   \r\nHalf of eligible voters need to vote for a referendum to pass, which activists say will work against them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f195c6f1dc860732e9bcfc93285554e5 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "News about the Earthquake in Nepal: a 7.8 magnitude quake struck Nepal on Saturday morning, killing over 1800 people.\n\nThe earthquake happened 81 km northwest of the capital Kathmandu with tremors sent through north India, Mount Everest and Tibet. Over 700 people have died in Nepal alone, with 42 people known to have died in India and 13 in Tibet. At least 17 people were killed from avalanches that resulted on Mount Everest.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal said to Indian television, \"We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done.\"\n\n\"Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid\", he added.\n\nAs the aftershocks continued to hit on Saturday, many residents opted to spend the night outside with thousands camping in Nepal's parade ground. Emergency workers have been sent to the affected areas, rescuing people trapped under buildings and homes. In certain areas, rescuers used their bare hands to search for survivors in the debris.\n\nGlobal charities and world leaders have begun offering aid to Nepal including China, Pakistan, the United States and the European Union. The United States embassy in Nepal has pledged an initial $1 million for immediate needs and a search and rescue team has been deployed by the US Agency for International Development.\n\nJustine Greening, Secretary of International Development in the UK said, \"The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes.\"\n\nOne of Nepal's historic landmarks, the Dharahara tower was destroyed with 60 bodies removed from the rubble. The quake also destroyed four our of seven UNESCO World Heritage sites in the area including the Boudhanath Stupa, one of the Himalayas' oldest Buddhist monuments.\n\nThe earthquake is the strongest that has occurred in the region in the past 80 years. It comes second to an 8.3 magnitude earthquake that happened on the Bihar-Nepal border in 1934.",

Landing in this terrain is a challenge, made more difficult by inclement weather in Nepal over the last few days.\n\nEntire villages have been flattened by the powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake. In these two small villages, 300 people are dead.\n\nThe IAF choppers are carrying tonnes of relief material - tents, noodles, medicines and water - neatly packaged in white parcels to distribute in the villages.\nAs they land, personnel of the Nepalese army take over the relief material.\n\nIn the meantime, vehicles of the Nepalese Red Cross ferry the most critically injured to the Indian helicopters, to be airlifted to base camp for treatment.",

      "description": "Perched atop a hill on the western edge of the Kathmandu Valley, the ancient Swayambunath Stupa (known to tourists as the Monkey Temple), a UNESCO world heritage site, is Kathmandu's most important Buddhist shrine. The sleepy, all-seeing Buddha eyes that stare out from the top have become the quintessential symbol of Nepal.\nWhen this temple was founded about 2,000 years ago, Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake. According to Buddhist legend, a single perfect lotus grew in the center of the lake. When the bodhisattva Manjusri drained the lake with a slash of his sword, the lotus flower settled on top of the hill and magically transformed into the stupa. Thus it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa.\n\nThe earliest written record of the Swayambunath Stupa's existence is a 5th-century stone inscription, but scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century. Even before that, it is likely that animist rites took place on this hill. Swayambunath is one of Nepal's oldest Buddhist temples and it has an ancient atmosphere, especially when one approaches on foot with the pilgrims.",

      "description": "This animated video explains what the Magnitude of the Earthquake on Richter Scale  means and how devastating it could be with every increment of every value.on Richter Scale.\n\nWhat is Ricter Scale: The Richter magnitude scale (also Richter scale) assigns a magnitude number to quantify the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, which defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude.\n\nAs measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times that of an earthquake that registered 4.0, and thus corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake.\n\nDeveloped in the 1930s, it was succeeded in the 1970s by the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) which is now the scale used to estimate magnitudes for all modern large earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey. However, earthquake magnitudes are still sometimes incorrectly reported as \"an earthquake of XX on the Richter scale\", when the correct terminology using the MMS is \"a magnitude XX earthquake.",

      "description": "I like to show you how Thamel looks 45 days after the earthquake. The news about the earthquake in Nepal were so awful that it surprised me to see the town in this condition. On the one hand the news brought thick pockets to the NGOs and all helping organizations and on the other hand they killed the tourism entirely. Nepal had 2 disastrous earthquakes - but only in some parts of the country. 18 out of 75 districts feature earthquake-related damage.\nThere is no reason to stay away from Nepal. Yes, there are damages in the town and on the countryside, but there is enough space to find save places. Of course there are some trekking areas completely destroyed, but there are many areas unharmed by the earthquake.",

      "description": "Nepal Earthquake  Landslide After Earthquake in Sindhupalchok.\n\nThe April 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake)] killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000. It occurred at 11:56 NST on 25 April, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw[1] or 8.1Ms[2] and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Its epicenter was east of the district of Lamjung, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 15 km (9.3 mi). It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19,[ making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened,[ across many districts of the country. Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley, including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Patan Durbar Squar, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Changu Narayan Temple and the Swayambhunath Stupa. Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture.\n\nContinued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal within 15–20 minute intervals, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST. The country also had a continued risk of landslides.\n\nA major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:51 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3.The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mt. Everest. More than 200 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured by this aftershock.\n\nA landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements. Rockfalls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows were common. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the area/slope prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released.",

Landing in this terrain is a challenge, made more difficult by inclement weather in Nepal over the last few days.\n\nEntire villages have been flattened by the powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake. In these two small villages, 300 people are dead.\n\nThe IAF choppers are carrying tonnes of relief material - tents, noodles, medicines and water - neatly packaged in white parcels to distribute in the villages.\nAs they land, personnel of the Nepalese army take over the relief material.\n\nIn the meantime, vehicles of the Nepalese Red Cross ferry the most critically injured to the Indian helicopters, to be airlifted to base camp for treatment.",

      "description": "Pashupatinath temple is the biggest Hindu temple of Lord Shiva in the world located on the banks of the Bagmati river in the eastern part of Kathmandu, the capital of Nepal. Pashupathinath is the guardian spirit and the holiest of all Shiva shrines in Nepal. Lord Shiva is known by many different names and Pashupati is one. Pashu means leaving beings, and Pati means master. The temple served as the seat of national deity, Lord Pashupatinath, until Nepal was secularized. Pashupatinath is not only the holiest Hindu pilgrimage in Nepal but also one of the holiest destinations in the entire world. Pashupatinath Temple architecture is distinctive Nepalese style pagoda. It is an extensive complex consisting of many other old and important temples and statues, making it a worthy visit even for non Hindus. This temple that has been declared UNESCO Heritage site has been erected and razed to the ground numerous times. There is historical evidence that a temple dedicated to Shiva existed at this site in AD 879.\n\nThe magnificent temple of Lord Pashupatinath, one of the most sacred Hindu temples of Nepal escaped the fury of the powerful earthquake with minor damages. The famous 5th century Pashupatinath Temple in Kathmandu survived the massive 7.9 magnitude earthquake that flattened several World Heritage sites in Nepal. Nepal has incurred heavy loss of lives as well as property in wake of the massive earthquake that hit the valley on 25th Saturday April 2015",

It is designed to combine the functionality of a conventional helicopter with the long-range, high-speed cruise performance of a turboprop aircraft.\n\nThe V-22 originated from the United States Department of Defense Joint-service Vertical take-off/landing Experimental (JVX) aircraft program started in 1981. The team of Bell Helicopter and Boeing Helicopters was awarded a development contract in 1983 for the tiltrotor aircraft. The Bell Boeing team jointly produce the aircraft. The V-22 first flew in 1989, and began flight testing and design alterations; the complexity and difficulties of being the first tiltrotor intended for military service in the world led to many years of development.\n\nThe United States Marine Corps began crew training for the Osprey in 2000, and fielded it in 2007; it supplemented and then replaced their Boeing Vertol CH-46 Sea Knights. The Osprey's other operator, the U.S. Air Force, fielded their version of the tiltrotor in 2009. Since entering service with the U.S. Marine Corps and Air Force, the Osprey has been deployed in transportation and medivac operations over Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya and Kuwait.",

      "description": "Perched atop a hill on the western edge of the Kathmandu Valley, the ancient Swayambunath Stupa (known to tourists as the Monkey Temple), a UNESCO world heritage site, is Kathmandu's most important Buddhist shrine. The sleepy, all-seeing Buddha eyes that stare out from the top have become the quintessential symbol of Nepal.\nWhen this temple was founded about 2,000 years ago, Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake. According to Buddhist legend, a single perfect lotus grew in the center of the lake. When the bodhisattva Manjusri drained the lake with a slash of his sword, the lotus flower settled on top of the hill and magically transformed into the stupa. Thus it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa.\n\nThe earliest written record of the Swayambunath Stupa's existence is a 5th-century stone inscription, but scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century. Even before that, it is likely that animist rites took place on this hill. Swayambunath is one of Nepal's oldest Buddhist temples and it has an ancient atmosphere, especially when one approaches on foot with the pilgrims.",

It is the center of Tibetan culture in Kathmandu and rich in Buddhist symbolism. The stupa is located in the town of Boudha, on the eastern outskirts of Kathmandu.\nBodnath was probably built in the 14th century after the Mughal invasions; various interesting legends are told regarding the reasons for its construction. After the arrival of thousands of Tibetans following the 1959 Chinese invasion, the temple has become one of the most important centers of Tibetan Buddhism. Today it remains an important place of pilgrimage and meditation for Tibetan Buddhists and local Nepalis, as well as a popular tourist site.",

      "description": "I like to show you how Thamel looks 45 days after the earthquake. The news about the earthquake in Nepal were so awful that it surprised me to see the town in this condition. On the one hand the news brought thick pockets to the NGOs and all helping organizations and on the other hand they killed the tourism entirely. Nepal had 2 disastrous earthquakes - but only in some parts of the country. 18 out of 75 districts feature earthquake-related damage.\nThere is no reason to stay away from Nepal. Yes, there are damages in the town and on the countryside, but there is enough space to find save places. Of course there are some trekking areas completely destroyed, but there are many areas unharmed by the earthquake.",

      "description": "Nepal Earthquake  Landslide After Earthquake in Sindhupalchok.\n\nThe April 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake)] killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000. It occurred at 11:56 NST on 25 April, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw[1] or 8.1Ms[2] and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Its epicenter was east of the district of Lamjung, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 15 km (9.3 mi). It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19,[ making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened,[ across many districts of the country. Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley, including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Patan Durbar Squar, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Changu Narayan Temple and the Swayambhunath Stupa. Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture.\n\nContinued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal within 15–20 minute intervals, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST. The country also had a continued risk of landslides.\n\nA major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:51 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3.The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mt. Everest. More than 200 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured by this aftershock.\n\nA landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements. Rockfalls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows were common. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the area/slope prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released.",

      "description": "News about the Earthquake in Nepal: a 7.8 magnitude quake struck Nepal on Saturday morning, killing over 1800 people.\n\nThe earthquake happened 81 km northwest of the capital Kathmandu with tremors sent through north India, Mount Everest and Tibet. Over 700 people have died in Nepal alone, with 42 people known to have died in India and 13 in Tibet. At least 17 people were killed from avalanches that resulted on Mount Everest.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal said to Indian television, \"We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done.\"\n\n\"Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid\", he added.\n\nAs the aftershocks continued to hit on Saturday, many residents opted to spend the night outside with thousands camping in Nepal's parade ground. Emergency workers have been sent to the affected areas, rescuing people trapped under buildings and homes. In certain areas, rescuers used their bare hands to search for survivors in the debris.\n\nGlobal charities and world leaders have begun offering aid to Nepal including China, Pakistan, the United States and the European Union. The United States embassy in Nepal has pledged an initial $1 million for immediate needs and a search and rescue team has been deployed by the US Agency for International Development.\n\nJustine Greening, Secretary of International Development in the UK said, \"The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes.\"\n\nOne of Nepal's historic landmarks, the Dharahara tower was destroyed with 60 bodies removed from the rubble. The quake also destroyed four our of seven UNESCO World Heritage sites in the area including the Boudhanath Stupa, one of the Himalayas' oldest Buddhist monuments.\n\nThe earthquake is the strongest that has occurred in the region in the past 80 years. It comes second to an 8.3 magnitude earthquake that happened on the Bihar-Nepal border in 1934.",

Landing in this terrain is a challenge, made more difficult by inclement weather in Nepal over the last few days.\n\nEntire villages have been flattened by the powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake. In these two small villages, 300 people are dead.\n\nThe IAF choppers are carrying tonnes of relief material - tents, noodles, medicines and water - neatly packaged in white parcels to distribute in the villages.\nAs they land, personnel of the Nepalese army take over the relief material.\n\nIn the meantime, vehicles of the Nepalese Red Cross ferry the most critically injured to the Indian helicopters, to be airlifted to base camp for treatment.",

      "description": "Perched atop a hill on the western edge of the Kathmandu Valley, the ancient Swayambunath Stupa (known to tourists as the Monkey Temple), a UNESCO world heritage site, is Kathmandu's most important Buddhist shrine. The sleepy, all-seeing Buddha eyes that stare out from the top have become the quintessential symbol of Nepal.\nWhen this temple was founded about 2,000 years ago, Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake. According to Buddhist legend, a single perfect lotus grew in the center of the lake. When the bodhisattva Manjusri drained the lake with a slash of his sword, the lotus flower settled on top of the hill and magically transformed into the stupa. Thus it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa.\n\nThe earliest written record of the Swayambunath Stupa's existence is a 5th-century stone inscription, but scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century. Even before that, it is likely that animist rites took place on this hill. Swayambunath is one of Nepal's oldest Buddhist temples and it has an ancient atmosphere, especially when one approaches on foot with the pilgrims.",

      "description": "This animated video explains what the Magnitude of the Earthquake on Richter Scale  means and how devastating it could be with every increment of every value.on Richter Scale.\n\nWhat is Ricter Scale: The Richter magnitude scale (also Richter scale) assigns a magnitude number to quantify the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, which defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude.\n\nAs measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times that of an earthquake that registered 4.0, and thus corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake.\n\nDeveloped in the 1930s, it was succeeded in the 1970s by the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) which is now the scale used to estimate magnitudes for all modern large earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey. However, earthquake magnitudes are still sometimes incorrectly reported as \"an earthquake of XX on the Richter scale\", when the correct terminology using the MMS is \"a magnitude XX earthquake.",

      "description": "I like to show you how Thamel looks 45 days after the earthquake. The news about the earthquake in Nepal were so awful that it surprised me to see the town in this condition. On the one hand the news brought thick pockets to the NGOs and all helping organizations and on the other hand they killed the tourism entirely. Nepal had 2 disastrous earthquakes - but only in some parts of the country. 18 out of 75 districts feature earthquake-related damage.\nThere is no reason to stay away from Nepal. Yes, there are damages in the town and on the countryside, but there is enough space to find save places. Of course there are some trekking areas completely destroyed, but there are many areas unharmed by the earthquake.",

      "description": "Nepal Earthquake  Landslide After Earthquake in Sindhupalchok.\n\nThe April 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake)] killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000. It occurred at 11:56 NST on 25 April, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw[1] or 8.1Ms[2] and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Its epicenter was east of the district of Lamjung, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 15 km (9.3 mi). It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19,[ making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened,[ across many districts of the country. Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley, including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Patan Durbar Squar, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Changu Narayan Temple and the Swayambhunath Stupa. Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture.\n\nContinued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal within 15–20 minute intervals, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST. The country also had a continued risk of landslides.\n\nA major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:51 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3.The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mt. Everest. More than 200 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured by this aftershock.\n\nA landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements. Rockfalls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows were common. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the area/slope prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released.",

      "description": "News about the Earthquake in Nepal: a 7.8 magnitude quake struck Nepal on Saturday morning, killing over 1800 people.\n\nThe earthquake happened 81 km northwest of the capital Kathmandu with tremors sent through north India, Mount Everest and Tibet. Over 700 people have died in Nepal alone, with 42 people known to have died in India and 13 in Tibet. At least 17 people were killed from avalanches that resulted on Mount Everest.\n\nAccording to the BBC, Information and Broadcasting Minister Minendra Rijal said to Indian television, \"We have launched a massive rescue and rehabilitation action plan and lots needs to be done.\"\n\n\"Our country is in a moment of crisis and we will require tremendous support and aid\", he added.\n\nAs the aftershocks continued to hit on Saturday, many residents opted to spend the night outside with thousands camping in Nepal's parade ground. Emergency workers have been sent to the affected areas, rescuing people trapped under buildings and homes. In certain areas, rescuers used their bare hands to search for survivors in the debris.\n\nGlobal charities and world leaders have begun offering aid to Nepal including China, Pakistan, the United States and the European Union. The United States embassy in Nepal has pledged an initial $1 million for immediate needs and a search and rescue team has been deployed by the US Agency for International Development.\n\nJustine Greening, Secretary of International Development in the UK said, \"The absolute priority must be to reach people who are trapped and injured, and provide shelter and protection to those who have lost their homes.\"\n\nOne of Nepal's historic landmarks, the Dharahara tower was destroyed with 60 bodies removed from the rubble. The quake also destroyed four our of seven UNESCO World Heritage sites in the area including the Boudhanath Stupa, one of the Himalayas' oldest Buddhist monuments.\n\nThe earthquake is the strongest that has occurred in the region in the past 80 years. It comes second to an 8.3 magnitude earthquake that happened on the Bihar-Nepal border in 1934.",

      "description": "For More Latest News Subscribe us:\n\nKATHMANDU:  Indian Air Force helicopters are rescuing people from the remotest parts of western Nepal, difficult to reach and among the worst affected by Saturday's earthquake that has killed over 4,000 people.\n\nNDTV accompanied one such Air Force rescue mission to two villages in the Dhanding district, near China. Landing in this terrain is a challenge, made more difficult by inclement weather in Nepal over the last few days.\n\nEntire villages have been flattened by the powerful 7.9-magnitude earthquake. In these two small villages, 300 people are dead.\n\nThe IAF choppers are carrying tonnes of relief material - tents, noodles, medicines and water - neatly packaged in white parcels to distribute in the villages.\nAs they land, personnel of the Nepalese army take over the relief material.\n\nIn the meantime, vehicles of the Nepalese Red Cross ferry the most critically injured to the Indian helicopters, to be airlifted to base camp for treatment.",

      "description": "Perched atop a hill on the western edge of the Kathmandu Valley, the ancient Swayambunath Stupa (known to tourists as the Monkey Temple), a UNESCO world heritage site, is Kathmandu's most important Buddhist shrine. The sleepy, all-seeing Buddha eyes that stare out from the top have become the quintessential symbol of Nepal.\nWhen this temple was founded about 2,000 years ago, Kathmandu Valley was filled with a great lake. According to Buddhist legend, a single perfect lotus grew in the center of the lake. When the bodhisattva Manjusri drained the lake with a slash of his sword, the lotus flower settled on top of the hill and magically transformed into the stupa. Thus it is known as the Self-Created (swayambhu) Stupa.\n\nThe earliest written record of the Swayambunath Stupa's existence is a 5th-century stone inscription, but scholars believe there was probably a shrine here as early as the 1st century. Even before that, it is likely that animist rites took place on this hill. Swayambunath is one of Nepal's oldest Buddhist temples and it has an ancient atmosphere, especially when one approaches on foot with the pilgrims.",

      "description": "This animated video explains what the Magnitude of the Earthquake on Richter Scale  means and how devastating it could be with every increment of every value.on Richter Scale.\n\nWhat is Ricter Scale: The Richter magnitude scale (also Richter scale) assigns a magnitude number to quantify the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, which defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude.\n\nAs measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times that of an earthquake that registered 4.0, and thus corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake.\n\nDeveloped in the 1930s, it was succeeded in the 1970s by the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) which is now the scale used to estimate magnitudes for all modern large earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey. However, earthquake magnitudes are still sometimes incorrectly reported as \"an earthquake of XX on the Richter scale\", when the correct terminology using the MMS is \"a magnitude XX earthquake.",

Nepal had 2 disastrous earthquakes - but only in some parts of the country. 18 out of 75 districts feature earthquake-related damage.\nThere is no reason to stay away from Nepal. Yes, there are damages in the town and on the countryside, but there is enough space to find save places. Of course there are some trekking areas completely destroyed, but there are many areas unharmed by the earthquake.",

It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19,[ making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened,[ across many districts of the country. Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley, including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Patan Durbar Squar, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Changu Narayan Temple and the Swayambhunath Stupa. Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture.\n\nContinued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal within 15–20 minute intervals, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST. The country also had a continued risk of landslides.\n\nA major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:51 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3.The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mt. Everest. More than 200 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured by this aftershock.\n\nA landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements. Rockfalls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows were common. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the area/slope prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released.",

Tribesmen walking down the road after voting \r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nIndonesians voted in their first direct presidential election Monday, with incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri facing a tough challenge from two former army generals in balloting seen as a key step toward democracy six years after the fall of dictator Suharto.\r\n\r\nPolls across the sprawling archipelago opened first in the eastern province of Papua, two hours ahead of the capital of Jakarta, where dozens of people milled in front of polling stations.\r\n\r\nElection officials in the capital reported a slow start to polling, attributing that to many voters in the soccer-mad nation staying up until dawn to watch the European championship match.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion surveys have shown Megawati - daughter of the country's founding father, Sukarno - trailing behind to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a retired general and former security minister who resigned from her Cabinet months ago to seek her job.\r\n\r\nBut the surveys also suggest no candidate is likely to garner more than 50 per cent of the votes, meaning there will have to be a runoff election between the two top vote-getters in September.\r\n\r\nThe election in the world's largest Muslim nation is a massive enterprise, with more than 155 million eligible voters spread across 13-thousand islands and three time zones. \r\n\r\nPreviously, presidents were selected by lawmakers acting as an electoral college.\r\n\r\nThree other candidates are also running, including General Wiranto, a former commander of the armed forces indicted by U.N. prosecutors in East Timor for crimes against humanity allegedly committed in that former Indonesian province in 1999.\r\n\r\nMegawati emerged as the country's most popular politician in the tumultuous days following the ouster in 1998 of Suharto, who had ruled Indonesia since overthrowing her father Sukarno in 1966. Her party won more than a third of the vote in free elections in 1999, when lawmakers still elected the president.\r\n\r\nBut in the past five years, Megawati's popularity waned because of her failure to combat corruption or improve the economy, and a perception that she is aloof and indifferent to the concerns of the people.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, ex-army general Yudhoyono is a polished operator who projects stability and reassurance. Wiranto, though tainted by the U.N indictment, has secured the support of the country's largest party.\r\n\r\nSurveys show Yudhoyono leading with about 40 per cent of the vote. Neither Megawati nor any other contender has more than 15 per cent, and a fifth of voters remain undecided.\r\n\r\nThe other presidential candidates are Amien Rais, former head of Muhammadiyah, Indonesia's second-largest Islamic organisation; and Hamzah Haz, who has served as Megawati's vice president.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ecaa34c0549ffe04b137e500ef9e6618 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

It is a free to play game on Steam, so go check it out. Thanks for watching this random footage from the game. Why not leave a rating on your way out. Below is a little more information about the game.\n\nLore \nAn ancient prophecy foretold that once the reign of the Titans had come to an end, one of the Three Gods would claim dominion over their brethren and rise to a position of ultimate power. That time has come, and now your god needs a champion. Will you rise to the challenge? \n\nThe Titans \nIn the ancient and deadly world of Ascend: Hand of Kul, blood is power. The Titans–colossal, bloodthirsty, immortal giants–lumber over the earth filling their mindless hunger with endless feasts of human souls. Humans pray to their gods in vain as their dismal villages fall to the Titans and the onslaught of their monstrous children. But all is not lost, as their prayers have been heard by new Gods who rise to claim their legacy. \n\nCaos \nPlayers enter this world as a Caos, a gigantic breed of mighty warriors created to serve the divine will of the Gods. Equipped with brutal weapons and the primal powers of Light, Darkness, or the Void, players combat the spawn of the immortal Titans while fending off attacks from rival players and establishing their influence in the global war.\nKey Features\nFree-to-Play \nAscend is a complete action RPG experience, free to play over Steam. \n\nSeamless Single and Multiplayer Action \nPlay with AND against other gamers as you each journey through your own private yet parallel paths to Ascension. While your experiences are separate, you will still be able to impact each other by sending them a blessing or surprising them with a curse. \n\nUltimate Prestige \nPledge your loyalty to one of the Three Gods – the chaotic goddess of darkness, the zealous god of light or the manipulative lord of the void – and pillage the land on their behalf. As you crush your enemies and spread your deity’s influence, other players will kneel before your rule. \n\nAscend \nThe largest rewards require the ultimate sacrifice-your character! But all is not lost, as each life dedicated to your god brings new abilities that help shape you into the ultimate Caos warrior. \n\nEvolving world \nBehold the world as it changes dynamically beneath your feet, bowing to your growing power. As you discover the secret of defeating the Titans and secure your god’s dominion over the world, you’ll claim your place as a legend.",

      "title": "An exclusive look at the 15th floor of the County City Building  (ABC57 News)",
      "description": "SOUTH BEND, Ind. – It's something most people don't even know exists. ABC 57 got an exclusive look at the 15th floor of the County City Building. \n\nA lot of employees there don't even know about it. \n\nSo, what happens there? David Kepple is the man behind the curtain.\n\nKepple is 83 years old and has a life story so vast, he could write a book or two. \n\nKepple is in charge of the St. Joseph County Radio Communications for the Emergency Management Association. \n\nHe and about 600 other people help emergency responders in this area communicate with each other whenever something happens, and their command center is in the 15th floor of the County City Building. \n\n“It's a back up. We're there if they need us,” says Kepple. “For any type of emergency.”\n\nHe and his team help make sure emergency responders can hear each other in case something bad happens. \n\nKepple says cell phones can fail and that's where they come in. \n\n“When everything else fails, we always fall back on amateur radios,” says Kepple. \n\nFor instance, when downtown South Bend lost power back in 2014, Kepple and his team were there. \n\n“We actually opened amateur stations in both of the hospitals,” says Kepple. \n\nThey made sure vital parts of the city were still able to communicate.\n\nAnd all of their radios and antennas and fancy buttons source from the 15th floor of the County City Building.\n\n“I've never heard of it referred to as the 15th floor. I knew it was up there but it was always kind of a mystery,” says South Bend City Clerk, John Voorde. \n\nVoorde has worked in the building since 1980 and says he's never been to or seen this level. \n\n“I don't know, the 14th floor is where they always stop,” says Robert E. Lee a security guard for the County City Building. \n\nA mystery to most, but a comfort to know there's something up there. \n\nKepple let ABC 57 follow him up to this mysterious spot.\n\nThe elevator buttons only reach to the 14th floor, so it was up three flights of stairs after that. \n\nOnce inside this James Bond-esque level, the buzz of the machinery was so loud it over-powered anyone's voice. \n\nKepple says that is where the magic happens. His team in their yellow vests all technologically communicate through this working zone in the County City Building that no one knew existed. \n\nA secret to most, but a big part of  Kepple's life. \n\nBecause he knows, in part, he is a major help to the safety of St. Joseph County. \n\n“This is something worthwhile,” says Kepple. \n\nIt's also important to note, everyone involved in this organization is volunteer and most of the radio equipment is donated. \n\nIf this is something you might be interested in, look for David and his team in the bright yellow vests at the Sunburst Race.\n\nBy Alyssa Marino @ ABC57 NEWS",

      "description": "http://www.gadgetguide.us/\nThis is my Suction Coffee Mug product review. This is a simple yet functional no-spill coffee-mug. The no-spill feature is not only a tight-locking lid but also a suction cup bottom that only suctions when it is tiled ever-so-slightly. It easily picks straight up. Similar to the Mighty mug (from Kickstarter) but without the coffee shower at 1/3 full. Overall a neat  coffee mug. Downsides being that the suction does not work on porous surfaces (like cloth) but worked very well on smooth ones (desks, linoleum, glass, painted wood etc). Also do not put it in the dishwasher or the suction will never work again.\nI will be reviewing Iphone, android, and windows phone accessories as well as motherboards, cases, Bare bone combo's, video cards, gaming accessories, and anything technology related!\nI have a passion for gadgets, gizmos, and anything I can disassemble! \n\nFriend Me On FaceBook: GadgetGuideUSA\nTwitter: GadgetGuideUSA \n\nPlease subscribe to see new weekly videos!\n\nIf you ever have any questions, comments, suggestion, or requests for me to review a specific product please let me know at:\nGadgetGuideUSA@gmail.com\n\nThank's for watching, I look forward to seeing you next time!\nhttp://www.gadgetguide.us/",

No damage or injuries were reported.\n\nNo injuries or damages were reported today after a magnitude 4.2 earthquake rattled Michigan and surrounding states shortly after noon.\n\nAn earthquake struck near Dallas on Sunday, shortly after 10:00 a.m. local time. The tremor was centered just southwest of the intersection of Highway 114 and Rochelle Boulevard in nearby Irving, Texas, and had a magnitude of 3.1, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. It occurred at a depth of 3.1 miles. \n\nAn earthquake occurred in Michigan this afternoon. The quake, centered nine miles southeast of Kalamazoo, hit at 12:23 PM. It was a magnitude 4.2 quake, which is not capable of causing major damage. However, it was felt here in southeast Michigan.\n\nThere is reason that the word earthquake is currently listed as a trending topic on the net as of Sunday morning, May 3. The USGS is reporting an earthquake of a 3.9 magnitude on the Richter Scale hitting 1km WNW of View Park-Windsor Hills, California on Sunday, at 11:07:18 UTC — or 4:07 a.m. local time — going only 9.9 km deep, which is approximately 6.1 miles deep.",

Tribesmen walking down the road after voting \r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nIndonesians voted in their first direct presidential election Monday, with incumbent Megawati Sukarnoputri facing a tough challenge from two former army generals in balloting seen as a key step toward democracy six years after the fall of dictator Suharto.\r\n\r\nPolls across the sprawling archipelago opened first in the eastern province of Papua, two hours ahead of the capital of Jakarta, where dozens of people milled in front of polling stations.\r\n\r\nElection officials in the capital reported a slow start to polling, attributing that to many voters in the soccer-mad nation staying up until dawn to watch the European championship match.\r\n\r\nPublic opinion surveys have shown Megawati - daughter of the country's founding father, Sukarno - trailing behind to Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono, a retired general and former security minister who resigned from her Cabinet months ago to seek her job.\r\n\r\nBut the surveys also suggest no candidate is likely to garner more than 50 per cent of the votes, meaning there will have to be a runoff election between the two top vote-getters in September.\r\n\r\nThe election in the world's largest Muslim nation is a massive enterprise, with more than 155 million eligible voters spread across 13-thousand islands and three time zones. \r\n\r\nPreviously, presidents were selected by lawmakers acting as an electoral college.\r\n\r\nThree other candidates are also running, including General Wiranto, a former commander of the armed forces indicted by U.N. prosecutors in East Timor for crimes against humanity allegedly committed in that former Indonesian province in 1999.\r\n\r\nMegawati emerged as the country's most popular politician in the tumultuous days following the ouster in 1998 of Suharto, who had ruled Indonesia since overthrowing her father Sukarno in 1966. Her party won more than a third of the vote in free elections in 1999, when lawmakers still elected the president.\r\n\r\nBut in the past five years, Megawati's popularity waned because of her failure to combat corruption or improve the economy, and a perception that she is aloof and indifferent to the concerns of the people.\r\n\r\nIn contrast, ex-army general Yudhoyono is a polished operator who projects stability and reassurance. Wiranto, though tainted by the U.N indictment, has secured the support of the country's largest party.\r\n\r\nSurveys show Yudhoyono leading with about 40 per cent of the vote. Neither Megawati nor any other contender has more than 15 per cent, and a fifth of voters remain undecided.\r\n\r\nThe other presidential candidates are Amien Rais, former head of Muhammadiyah, Indonesia's second-largest Islamic organisation; and Hamzah Haz, who has served as Megawati's vice president.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/ecaa34c0549ffe04b137e500ef9e6618 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "CERN sits on the graveyard and chapel called “Voltaire’s Castle\n\nMatthew 27:48-54New King James Version (NKJV)\n\n48 Immediately one of them ran and took a sponge, filled it with sour wine and put it on a reed, and offered it to Him to drink.\n\n49 The rest said, “Let Him alone; let us see if Elijah will come to save Him.”\n\n50 And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit.\n\n51 Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, 52 and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; 53 and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many.\n\n54 So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, “Truly this was the Son of God!”\n\n2 Thessalonians 2 King James Version (KJV)\n\n2 Now we beseech you, brethren, by the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ, and by our gathering together unto him,\n\n2 That ye be not soon shaken in mind, or be troubled, neither by spirit, nor by word, nor by letter as from us, as that the day of Christ is at hand.\n\n3 Let no man deceive you by any means: for that day shall not come, except there come a falling away first, and that man of sin be revealed, the son of perdition;\n\n4 Who opposeth and exalteth himself above all that is called God, or that is worshipped; so that he as God sitteth in the temple of God, shewing himself that he is God.\n\n5 Remember ye not, that, when I was yet with you, I told you these things?\n\n6 And now ye know what withholdeth that he might be revealed in his time.\n\n7 For the mystery of iniquity doth already work: only he who now letteth will let, until he be taken out of the way.\n\n8 And then shall that Wicked be revealed, whom the Lord shall consume with the spirit of his mouth, and shall destroy with the brightness of his coming:\n\n9 Even him, whose coming is after the working of Satan with all power and signs and lying wonders,\n\n10 And with all deceivableness of unrighteousness in them that perish; because they received not the love of the truth, that they might be saved.\n\n11 And for this cause God shall send them strong delusion, that they should believe a lie:\n\n12 That they all might be damned who believed not the truth, but had pleasure in unrighteousness.\n\n13 But we are bound to give thanks alway to God for you, brethren beloved of the Lord, because God hath from the beginning chosen you to salvation through sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth:\n\n14 Whereunto he called you by our gospel, to the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ.\n\n15 Therefore, brethren, stand fast, and hold the traditions which ye have been taught, whether by word, or our epistle.\n\n16 Now our Lord Jesus Christ himself, and God, even our Father, which hath loved us, and hath given us everlasting consolation and good hope through grace,\n\n17 Comfort your hearts, and stablish you in every good word and work.\n\n1 Thessalonians 5:9-12King James Version (KJV)\n\n9 For God hath not appointed us to wrath, but to obtain salvation by our Lord Jesus Christ,",

      "description": "The Underground: Chs. 9 & 10, Fugitives, Betrayed\n\nLate Thursday night, Judd drove Vicki, Lionel, and Ryan to Nicolae High, where Vicki had left a window slightly open, leading to the showers in the gym locker room.\n\nJudd parked a few blocks away and each kid grabbed a box filled with the Underground.\n\nThis was their best issue yet. With John's expertise with the publishing program, it looked professionally printed. Readers of the Underground would learn that the Bible predicted the signing of the treaty that coming Monday. Assuming it came off as the paper outlined, readers should be convinced that the writers knew what they were talking about. They would be urged to give their lives to Christ before the beginning of the Tribulation. John and Mark had even included an untraceable Email address where students could write for more information and a Bible study.\n\nThe kids knew the prophecy could also backfire. If Bruce was wrong about the signing of the peace treaty with Israel, their message wouldn't ring true. It was a risk they were willing to take.\n\nThe Underground: Chs. 9 & 10, Fugitives, Betrayed\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

      "description": "Introduction to Thought Field Therapy (TFT) an early treatment utilizing acupressure for the mind and emotions.  The video provides some information on how TFT started and how powerful it is as a treatment for phobias, anxiety, trauma and panic attacks.  This is one of the therapy methods that Steve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT uses to treat people in the Dallas, Plano, Richardson, Texas and DFW area.\n\nVideo Transcript:\nTFT, 2003, www.psychotherapy-center.com\nFirst, I probably need to go back to the work\nof Dr. Roger Callahan who developed a method\ncall all Thought Field Therapy\nTFT was one of the first acupressure\nbased interventions to help people\nalleviate mental and emotional distress.\nin fact all the work talking about today\nmight  neatly fall under the title of\nacupressure for the mind and emotions.\nIn fact this is radically different paradigm\nfor treating mental and\nemotional distress. In traditional therapies,\ncognitive interventions, basically trying to change the way people\nthink about a problem has been utilized.  Behavioral interventions, changing\nthe way one behaves has been utilized, and other techniques as well.\nSteve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT.  But this is a very new\nway of looking at intervening upon mental and emotional distress.\nStart of TFT.  In the late 70s, Dr.\nRoger Callahan was exposed to\nsome work that some chiropractors were doing.  And they had begun to experiment \nwith the use of\nacupuncture, rather than acupuncture, \nactually just a gentle pressure or tapping on the acupuncture point\nrather than using needles, to try to intervene at an\nemotional level. A friend of his invited him to a demonstration\nand he was actually quite impressed with what he saw.\nHe took some training and\nbegin to work on his own then to experiment with and\nexplore the development of a method which\neventually became Thought Field Therapy.\nStory of Mary.  One of the stories that he told when I took\ntraining with him a number of years ago was about\na lady named Mary that he work with.  Mary was an\nindividually who had a tremendous fear of water.\nShe'd had this fear\nwater as long as she could remember.  She did not like\nto bathe in it.  She did not like to look at it.  She didn't like to \ndrink it. She really wanted nothing\nto do water.  Dr. Callahan\ntried cognitive therapy with her, he'd been a cognitive therapist\nfor 40 years and I think he had worked at Albert Ellis's Cognitive therapy \ninstitute in Chicago . But \nhe had attempted cognitive therapy as an intervention\nand that wasn't working.  So\nhe then was trying a behavioral\nintervention system referred to as systematic desensitization.\nIt is a fairly simple idea.  It's a technique in \nwhich one behaviorally, gradually, begins to approach something\nthat they feel a sense of fear about and at the\npoint that the fear begins to rise, they will do some\nrelaxation exercises to try to restore a state of\nrelaxation.  The basic idea is that fear and tension\nand relaxation are mutually exclusive and cannot exist\nat the same place at the same time.  So if you can get a person\nrelaxed enough that can help actually desensitize\ntheir overly\nsensitive response to the object of their fear. He had\ninvited Mary to his home where he had a large swimming pool.\nAnd the protocol was to see how close she could\nwalk toward the swimming pool before\nthat state of fear would begin to\ncome upon her.  Well, he'd never gotten her within\n20 feet of it basically. And it really wasn't going very well\nso he was at his wits end.  And he asked her, he said, \nMary would you be willing to try something\na little different like an experiment.  \nShe said, sure Dr. Callahan, I'd be glad to.  I'll try anything. \nAnd what he asked her to do \nwas to hold an acupressure point. A spot just\nbelow the eyes on the\nupper part of the cheekbone.  And he asked her to\nhold that and to gently tap it while\nshe thought about her fear of water.  She did so, and\nthat went on for a few minutes. And then all of a sudden\nhe reported that she stopped and said that's weird.\nAnd he said what's weird?  And she says, that feeling\nthat I get in my stomach when I feel this fear of \nwater, it's not there.  While Dr. Callahan\nwas thinking about this, she gets up and\nbolts toward the swimming pool.  Now that freaked him out.\nHe thought, oh my gosh, it looks like she's going to jump in.\nHis first thought was, Mary you can't swim stop.  He yelled\nthat out and she just broke down laughing.  She says Dr. Callahan,\nI'm no I can't swim.  I \nhaven't lost my mind, but she said\nI may have lost my fear.  And she went and\nliterally sat down by the pool, and he reported that she dropped\nher feet in and splashed her feet in the pool like a little kid.\nAt that moment she did lose her fear and never had\nanother moment of panic or\nfear or any other phobic responses about water from that point forward.\nSteve B.

      "description": "Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,\n\"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.\n\"And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.\n\"Again he sent out other slaves saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, \"Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.\"'\n\"But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,\nand the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.\n\"But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.\n\"Then he said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.\n'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.'\n\"Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.\n\"But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,\nand he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless.\n\"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\"For many are called, but few are chosen.\"\nThen the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.\nAnd they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.\n\"Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?\"\nBut Jesus perceived their malice, and said, \"Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?\n\"Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.\" And they brought Him a denarius.\nAnd He said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\"\nThey said to Him, \"Caesar's.\" Then He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.\"\nAnd hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.\nOn that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him,\nasking, \"Teacher, Moses said, 'IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.'\n\"Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother;\nso also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.\n\"Last of all, the woman died.\n\"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.\"\nBut Jesus answered and said to them, \"You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God.\n\"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\n\"But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:\n'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\"\nWhen the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.\nBut when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together.\nOne of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,\n\"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?\"\nAnd He said to him, \" 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'\n\"This is the great and foremost commandment.\n\"The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'\n\"On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.\"\nNow while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:\n\"What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?\" They said to Him, \"The son of David.\"\nHe said to them, \"Then how does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying,\n'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, \"SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET\"'?\n\"If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his son?\"\nNo one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

      "description": "Then Jesus spoke to the crowds and to His disciples,\nsaying: \"The scribes and the Pharisees have seated themselves in the chair of Moses;\ntherefore all that they tell you, do and observe, but do not do according to their deeds; for they say things and do not do them.\n\"They tie up heavy burdens and lay them on men's shoulders, but they themselves are unwilling to move them with so much as a finger.\n\"But they do all their deeds to be noticed by men; for they broaden their phylacteries and lengthen the tassels of their garments.\n\"They love the place of honor at banquets and the chief seats in the synagogues,\nand respectful greetings in the market places, and being called Rabbi by men.\n\"But do not be called Rabbi; for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.\n\"Do not call anyone on earth your father; for One is your Father, He who is in heaven.\n\"Do not be called leaders; for One is your Leader, that is, Christ.\n\"But the greatest among you shall be your servant.\n\"Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled; and whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.\n\"But woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you shut off the kingdom of heaven from people; for you do not enter in yourselves, nor do you allow those who are entering to go in.\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you devour widows' houses, and for a pretense you make long prayers; therefore you will receive greater condemnation.\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites, because you travel around on sea and land to make one proselyte; and when he becomes one, you make him twice as much a son of hell as yourselves.\n\"Woe to you, blind guides, who say, 'Whoever swears by the temple, that is nothing; but whoever swears by the gold of the temple is obligated.'\n\"You fools and blind men! Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?\n\"And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.'\n\"You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering?\n\"Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it.\n\"And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it.\n\"And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you tithe mint and dill and cummin, and have neglected the weightier provisions of the law: justice and mercy and faithfulness; but these are the things you should have done without neglecting the others.\n\"You blind guides, who strain out a gnat and swallow a camel!\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you clean the outside of the cup and of the dish, but inside they are full of robbery and self-indulgence.\n\"You blind Pharisee, first clean the inside of the cup and of the dish, so that the outside of it may become clean also.\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you are like whitewashed tombs which on the outside appear beautiful, but inside they are full of dead men's bones and all uncleanness.\n\"So you, too, outwardly appear righteous to men, but inwardly you are full of hypocrisy and lawlessness.\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites! For you build the tombs of the prophets and adorn the monuments of the righteous,\nand say, 'If we had been living in the days of our fathers, we would not have been partners with them in shedding the blood of the prophets.'\n\"So you testify against yourselves, that you are sons of those who murdered the prophets.\n\"Fill up, then, the measure of the guilt of your fathers.\n\"You serpents, you brood of vipers, how will you escape the sentence of hell?\n\"Therefore, behold, I am sending you prophets and wise men and scribes; some of them you will kill and crucify, and some of them you will scourge in your synagogues, and persecute from city to city,\nso that upon you may fall the guilt of all the righteous blood shed on earth, from the blood of righteous Abel to the blood of Zechariah, the son of Berechiah, whom you murdered between the temple and the altar.\n\"Truly I say to you, all these things will come upon this generation.\n\"Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her! How often I wanted to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her chicks under her wings, and you were unwilling.\n\"Behold, your house is being left to you desolate!\n\"For I say to you, from now on you will not see Me until you say, 'BLESSED IS HE WHO COMES IN THE NAME OF THE LORD!'\"\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.\"\nNow while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.\nAnd when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,\nand said, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.'\n\"And if this should come to the governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.\"\nAnd they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.\nBut the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.\nWhen they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful.\nAnd Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, \"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.\n\"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,\nteaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\"\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

      "description": "\"Nature in our Backyard: The Trinity River & Great Trinity Forest\"\n\nFine photographic prints by Dan Burkholder, Scot Miller, Jill Skupin Burkholder & R.P. Washburne\n\nJune 25 – August 22, 2015\n\nThe Trinity River and Great Trinity Forest have been receiving much attention, for a variety of reasons, but it’s no secret that the river dominated the spotlight recently. Thousands flocked to its banks to experience the sights of the flood waters. However, the reality is most people know little about the true nature of river and forest as they exist year-round. Sun to Moon Gallery and four talented photographers have worked to change that. For ten years now, the photographers have spent time on and along the river and in and around the forest, including many beautiful but lesser-known areas, creatively interpreting with their cameras. In the process, they have created an ever-expanding and changing body of work that includes engaging new photographs of the flooded Trinity by Scot Miller and R.P. Washburne.\n\nFrom vivid digitally captured images, to stunning detail studies with film and a medium-format camera, to bromoil prints overlaid with color pigments, to 24k Gold Leaf Prints and more; a wide range of subject matter, artistic expression and photographic techniques form the basis of this eye-opening exhibition. Sun to Moon Gallery invites the public to come, be inspired, and see the river, forest and city in a new light!\n\nNew short films by Scot Miller –\n\nScot Miller, a contributor to the “Moment in Nature” videos, broadcast nationally on Emmy Award-winning CBS Sunday Morning, also spent many hours and days over the past months capturing stunning 4k video footage of the river and forest, including many time sequences. He has created several short films, including one featuring the floods, that will be screened in the gallery throughout the exhibition.",

      "description": "It fell into my heart about two weeks ago to write you this letter. I sat down right away to do it but to me it felt superficial, and not really from my heart, so I put it on the back burner until now.\n\nThen I was awakened from sleep and the words began to come to me concerning what I really wanted to say, so I came to jot them down.\n\nI recently watched a video of a shepherdess caring for her sheep... she led them to good pasture where they grazed till their hearts were content. That's what canDEElicious Video Ministry is all about... preparing ground for you to graze on. Come over here the table is spread and the feast of the Lord is going on.\n\nIn the video there were also baby lambs that the shepherdess fed with a milk bottle, reminding me of Jesus' words to Peter, \"Feed My Lambs.\"\n\nAlthough the Lord did not call me to be a shepherd, He made me a hireling to feed His sheep and His  little lambs. With all my heart, I want to do my best and be a worthy vessel for His use. When you watch these videos, I want the Lord to touch your hearts and bring you a sense that He is speaking directly to you.\n\nHeb 4:12 says the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. That's why it sounds like He is speaking directly to you.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nLately, I've been feeling like such a failure at living up to His calling and election. My attitude toward God and misunderstanding His will for my life has left me wanting.\n\nOne of the things that I never want to happen as I teach God's word to others is that I myself would not live up to it through my disobedience and obstinance.\n\nA few years ago, I was so offended with God that I refused to pray. Prayer didn't seem practical because my expectations were not being met. So I weaned off. There were times when the Holy Spirit would unction me to pray and I would kindly decline, \"No thank You.\" I didn't feel mad at God. Prayer just simply felt impractical so I failed to maintain a good prayer life.\n\nBut I woke up one morning the The Temptations fell in my heart and I couldn't shake it... \n\nI can fly like a bird in the sky\nAnd I can buy anything money can buy\nI can turn a river into a raging fire\nI can live forever if I so desire\nUnimportant are all the things I can do\nCause I can't get next to babe\nCan't get next to you.\n\nI felt that I had let my Lord down feeding Him from a long-handled spoon. He was knocking at the door of my heart but my pride kept me at a distance. But I thought it was so sweet that He said with all of His power to do anything He wants to do - the one thing escaping Him was getting me to open up.\n\nJesus said, \"Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.\"\n\nGod's love is poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit but we must first open our hearts to Him and invite Him in (or back in, if He's been pushed aside).\n\nPerhaps today you have decided that you want to get closer to the Lord. Reach out to Him, let Him right the wrongs. He said His grace is sufficient... and He is strong where we are weak.\n\nLet God arise and His enemies be scattered. Submit yourselves to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.\n\nThank you, our Subscribers. We're praying for you and sincerely hoping these Bible teachings are helping you. We'll see you again soon.\n\nMay God bless and keep you and make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you His peace.\n\nBlog: http://richardsonblogger.blogspot.com/",

      "description": "Village Tech Schools, a charter school serving grades pre-K through 12, is in the design stage of their new permanent campus to be located near Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill's historic downtown. WRA Architects of Dallas is designing the school, and Northstar Builders of Coppell has been selected as the Construction Manager, or builder.\n\"We are thrilled to partner with WRA and the City of Cedar Hill on this exciting new project,\" said David Williams, Village Tech's founder and CEO. \"When we're finished, the school will enclose 168,000 square feet in four separate buildings and will serve up to 1,040 students.\"\nThe four structures include a 3-story classroom building for grades 3-12, a preschool for grades PreK-2, a gymnasium and dining building, and \"the Forge.\"\nThe Forge is the heart of the school and embodies Village Tech's educational philosophy. It includes maker spaces, art studios, computer labs, and presentation and demonstration space. This is where students from all grade levels will design and construct projects that relate to and illustrate their curriculum in all core subjects.\nKeith Anderson, AIA, is WRA's director of design and principal-in-charge of the project. He commented, \"Village Tech has a wonderfully innovative approach to education, and working with them on bringing their vision to life on a new campus has been very exciting for our design team.\"\nThe campus will be one of the first projects in the redevelopment of Cedar Hill's urban center and hopes to be a catalyst for further development of this area. The school will hold its \"Home of Tomorrow\" preview of the new campus on the future school site at 100 Carrell Street in Cedar Hill on Saturday, December 12, from 11 am to 2 pm.\nConstruction will start in mid-2016.",

      "description": "This animated video explains what the Magnitude of the Earthquake on Richter Scale  means and how devastating it could be with every increment of every value.on Richter Scale.\n\nWhat is Ricter Scale: The Richter magnitude scale (also Richter scale) assigns a magnitude number to quantify the energy released by an earthquake. The Richter scale is a base-10 logarithmic scale, which defines magnitude as the logarithm of the ratio of the amplitude of the seismic waves to an arbitrary, minor amplitude.\n\nAs measured with a seismometer, an earthquake that registers 5.0 on the Richter scale has a shaking amplitude 10 times that of an earthquake that registered 4.0, and thus corresponds to a release of energy 31.6 times that released by the lesser earthquake.\n\nDeveloped in the 1930s, it was succeeded in the 1970s by the Moment Magnitude Scale (MMS) which is now the scale used to estimate magnitudes for all modern large earthquakes by the United States Geological Survey. However, earthquake magnitudes are still sometimes incorrectly reported as \"an earthquake of XX on the Richter scale\", when the correct terminology using the MMS is \"a magnitude XX earthquake.",

      "description": "The 7.8 magnitude earthquake of April 25 took over 8,500 lives and destroyed about 2,00,000 houses. Phulkharka village near the epicenter was one of the hard hit villages, where 27 people lost their lives, 95% houses were destroyed and hundreds of cattle were buried in rubble. \nPhulkharka is located in the foothills of Ganesh Himal (4,429 m), 135 km northwest of Kathmandu. The main income of the village is agriculture with majority of its men working in Middle East or in Kathmandu earning supplementary income for the family. Because of climate depended traditional farming, agriculture is subsistence.\nThe village is perched high up along the flank for 3,200 m mountain with scenic higher reaches offering panoramic view of Manaslu and Ganesh Himal range. Its pristine, forested higher reaches make a beautiful short trek. The village is also culturally rich with its ethnic diversity. Tamangs here still practice Shamanism in its intact form. Because of forested higher reaches, the village is source of water for surrounding 5 village development committees.   \nPhulkharka village development with population of about 7,500 people has 7 primary schools and one high school. All school buildings were destroyed in the tremor sighting the need of more sophisticated, earthquake proof school buildings which could be used as shelters in case of natural disaster. \nGanga Jamuna Youth club has been providing immediate relief materials and volunteers to erect temporary shelters. The aftershocks, government policies and soon coming monsoon will delay the construction of permanent structures by few months. We are planning to mobilize more volunteers to accomplish the task of rebuilding. \nWe would like to request international and nation communities to support us in the campaign by technical or financial aid. \nWe need skilled volunteers and technicians in construction. Please visit the link for further information. http://www.itournepal.com/volunteernepal.php\n\nYou can also support our cause financially at http://www.youcaring.com/emergency-fundraiser/rebuilding-school-damaged-by-nepal-earthquake-/354800",

On the one hand the news brought thick pockets to the NGOs and all helping organizations and on the other hand they killed the tourism entirely. Nepal had 2 disastrous earthquakes - but only in some parts of the country. 18 out of 75 districts feature earthquake-related damage.\nThere is no reason to stay away from Nepal. Yes, there are damages in the town and on the countryside, but there is enough space to find save places. Of course there are some trekking areas completely destroyed, but there are many areas unharmed by the earthquake.",

      "description": "Nepal Earthquake  Landslide After Earthquake in Sindhupalchok.\n\nThe April 2015 Nepal earthquake (also known as the Gorkha earthquake)] killed more than 9,000 people and injured more than 23,000. It occurred at 11:56 NST on 25 April, with a magnitude of 7.8Mw[1] or 8.1Ms[2] and a maximum Mercalli Intensity of IX (Violent). Its epicenter was east of the district of Lamjung, and its hypocenter was at a depth of approximately 15 km (9.3 mi). It was the worst natural disaster to strike Nepal since the 1934 Nepal–Bihar earthquake.\n\nThe earthquake triggered an avalanche on Mount Everest, killing at least 19,[ making April 25, 2015 the deadliest day on the mountain in history. The earthquake triggered another huge avalanche in the Langtang valley, where 250 people were reported missing.\n\nHundreds of thousands of people were made homeless with entire villages flattened,[ across many districts of the country. Centuries-old buildings were destroyed at UNESCO World Heritage sites in the Kathmandu Valley, including some at the Kathmandu Durbar Square, the Patan Durbar Squar, the Bhaktapur Durbar Square, the Changu Narayan Temple and the Swayambhunath Stupa. Geophysicists and other experts had warned for decades that Nepal was vulnerable to a deadly earthquake, particularly because of its geology, urbanization, and architecture.\n\nContinued aftershocks occurred throughout Nepal within 15–20 minute intervals, with one shock reaching a magnitude of 6.7 on 26 April at 12:54:08 NST. The country also had a continued risk of landslides.\n\nA major aftershock occurred on 12 May 2015 at 12:51 NST with a moment magnitude (Mw) of 7.3.The epicenter was near the Chinese border between the capital of Kathmandu and Mt. Everest. More than 200 people were killed and more than 2,500 were injured by this aftershock.\n\nA landslide, also known as a landslip, is a geological phenomenon that includes a wide range of ground movements. Rockfalls, deep failure of slopes and shallow debris flows were common. Landslides can occur in offshore, coastal and onshore environments. Although the action of gravity is the primary driving force for a landslide to occur, there are other contributing factors affecting the original slope stability. Typically, pre-conditional factors build up specific sub-surface conditions that make the area/slope prone to failure, whereas the actual landslide often requires a trigger before being released.",

Maybe one day he can remarry and have children again.\"\r\nResident Naomi Fujino was in tears recalling what had happened to her family on March 11 last year.\r\nShe was with her parents when they heard the sirens warning of the tsunami coming.\r\nWith her mother, she escaped to the closest hill and had promised to meet up with her father there.\r\nMother and daughter watched as the giant tsunami swept away their home, praying that the father had escaped.\r\nThey waited all night but he never came to meet them.\r\nTwo months later, with help of DNA testing, his body was found.\r\n\"I wanted to save people but I couldn't. I couldn't even help my father. I cannot keep on crying. What can I do but keep on going,\" Fujino said.\r\nLater on Sunday, memorials will be held in all the locations that were destroyed, and tens of thousands of residents will come together in silent prayer at the exact moment when the earthquake struck, at 14:46 local time.\r\nThe devastating tsunami enveloped the north-eastern coast shortly afterwards.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7e846cda2dbe399b0eca08cc87ca6380 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

I can''t sell products that are inedible so I would like some sort of guarantee by the government,\" he said.\r\nSix months after the catastrophe, even though the fishing industry has restarted, Komatsu and other residents were still concerned about the radiation levels of the waters in the area.\r\nAnother resident, 80-year-old Takeji Iwabuchi, also expressed concern about the future of the city.\r\n\"It still surprises me to see the amount of debris left. I wonder when this place will actually revive,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6e109e2159d3641a87e3a80c338392bb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Life has been put on hold for most residents of a small Japanese fishing town following the devastating earthquake and tsunami on 11 March.  \r\nThree months after the disaster struck, Minamisanriku in Miyagi Prefecture largely remains flattened, with many complaining of painstakingly slow reconstruction efforts. \r\nRubble still blankets the ground, while residents sit patiently in makeshift tents waiting for their homes to be rebuilt. \r\n\"It's been three months�and I feel that time has frozen since the day of the disaster,\" construction manager Shoji Sato says.\r\nAs post-tsunami Japan strains under the enormous task of rebuilding many towns like Minamisanriku, the sheer extent of the devastation means resources are stretched. \r\nSome residents have tried to use debris lying around to rebuild their homes, including school teacher Yasuaki Yoshida. \r\nOut of a population of 17,666, at least 542 Minamisanriku residents have been confirmed dead and 664 still missing. \r\nOver four thousand people are still scattered in shelters. \r\nOthers have moved themselves into temporary homes or left Minamisanriku to stay with relatives.   \r\nThe port city was once a busy town with supermarkets, shopping centres, banks, offices, schools and over 5-thousand houses.   \r\nThe tsunami swept away nearly every business, every job. \r\nElectricity returned in mid-May, but enough water is only running for washing dirty clothes and flushing toilets.   \r\nThe water contains too much salt to cook, but residents say they take baths in it anyway because that is all they have.    \r\nIkuko Abe lost her home and her livelihood, working in a hair salon, following the disaster. \r\nNow she works everyday as a volunteer making lunch and dinner for people living in an evacuation centre in the town.  \r\n\"How long will it take for us to get back everything that used to exist, like supermarkets, hospitals, the town hall�I have no idea how long it will take for us to get our town back. Probably decades,\" she says wearily.\r\nEvery day, bulldozers organise debris into separate piles; wood to be used as fuel, or piles of scrap metal to be hauled away.    \r\nBut no one knows when the city will get back on its feet and local residents don't appear hopeful about their town's future.\r\n\"I wonder if it will be any different in August,\" says a 92-year-old town resident, now living in temporary housing accomodation.\r\nThe pulverised coast is still being hit by hundreds of small aftershocks each day. \r\nJapan is located on the Ring of Fire, an arc of volcanoes and fault lines spanning the Pacific Basin, and is regularly hit by earthquakes.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/63a2c8952cada5979f6ce8f0c6df4150 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Close up of shrine gate.    \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe town of Otsuchi was almost entirely destroyed by the tsunami which hit Japan a month ago, but a shrine in the small fishing village was spared, something locals believe is nothing short of a miracle.\r\nWhen the magnitude 9 earthquake hit the town of Otsuchi, many were evacuated to the shrine because it sits on higher ground. \r\nThe tsunami which followed reached the shrine's outer gate and so people moved to even higher ground because they rightly believed a second tsunami would follow. \r\nThe second wave swept the town, destroying thousands of homes, but again stopped just short of the shrine.\r\nWhile most of the evacuees fled to higher ground, a group of five people stayed on and they were then forced to fight a fire caused by the tsunami, which again threatened the shrine.\r\nThe group managed to put out the fire but charred earth surrounds the building, testament to how close the shrine came to burning down.\r\n\"I used a wood stick to make a barrier and somehow we were able to stop the fire. I thought it was because of the shrine's God. It was really hot because of the fire. I prayed the God and the shrine would escape the fire,\" said Yasuhiro Usuzawa, a local resident who fought the fire.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/07a87a27682c246e1f7d145000a06ea9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

We are trying to retrieve bodies as cleanly as possible.\"  \r\n12. Various of trucks at search operation\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nSirens wailed and people bowed their heads and wept along Japan's devastated northeast coast on Monday as they marked a month since the tsunami that killed up to 25-thousand people and unleashed a persistent nuclear crisis.\r\nIn Kesennuma, among the worst-hit cities in Miyagi prefecture, members of Japan's Self Defence Force carrying out the search operation for the missing, gathered for the moment of silence ceremony at 2:46 p.m., (05:46 GMT) the exact moment of the magnitude-9.0 quake that spawned the tsunami March 11.\r\nAfter an announcement by the city government on a speaker, soldiers and civilians stopped their work and took off their helmets as the noisy clatter of searching equipment ceased briefly.\r\nWith thousands of bodies yet to be found, a tsunami-flooded nuclear power plant still spewing radiation and more than 150-thousand people living in shelters, there was little time for reflection on Japan's worst disaster since World War II.\r\nIn Kesennuma, about 700 are confirmed dead and about 1,400 are still missing, according to city officials.\r\nAbout 600 members of the Self Defence Force continue to search for bodies.\r\n\"It is impossible for us to remove the mass of rubble by just manpower, so we have to use heavy equipment but must do it very carefully. We are trying to retrieve bodies as cleanly as possible,\" Colonel Toshiki Fujioka, Regimental commander said.\r\nThe earthquake and tsunami flattened communities along hundreds of miles (kilometres) of coastline, causing what the government estimates could be as much as 310 (b) billion US dollars in damage. \r\nMore than 158-thousand people are still without electricity and 210-thousand have no running water, although some of that is because of a 7.1-magnitude aftershock that rattled the area last week.\r\nAdding to the misery is radiation spewing from the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear complex 140 miles (220 kilometres) northeast of Tokyo, which lost its cooling systems when water from the tsunami washed over it.\r\nGovernment officials have already ordered the 70-thousand to 80-thousand people who live within 12 miles (120 kilometres) to leave.\r\nOn Monday Japan's government said it is urging even more people to evacuate the area with Chief Cabinet Secretary saying that residents of five additional communities, some more than 20 miles (30 kilometres) from the plant, are being urged to leave within a month.\r\nHe said it's not an emergency, but that high radiation levels have been detected in some places and there are concerns about long-term health risks as the crisis drags on.\r\nMeanwhile workers at Fukushima Dai-ichi continue to struggle to remove contaminated water that has prevented them from restoring cooling systems. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b2a2ec304778f0b847f53eca0a0c997c \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide top shot of devastation and debris at Minamisanriku \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nMary Caitlin Churchill is a school teacher in Minamisanriku. She was in a school when the earthquake hit last Friday. She was in the teacher's room, with colleagues, when there was a tsunami warning, and they went out on the field. \r\nThey thought they were safe at the field, but when they saw the water rising and going up the school, they had to run to higher ground, up in the mountains, behind the school. \r\nWhen she was in the mountains, she saw water filling up the fields, cars were floating, car alarms were going off, and the gym next to school was completely destroyed. \r\nShe spent the rest of the day mostly in shock, but also tried to comfort elementary students terrified of what was happening to their home town. \r\n\"It was still terrifying once we got to the top,\" Churchill said and she went on: \"we didn't know if more water was going to come, if there was going to be another tsunami, so we were kind at the highest point that we could get.\" \r\nCanon Purdy was in Minamisanriku to attend a graduation ceremony for some of her former students at Shizugawa Junior High School. \r\nThe school was located on top of a hill and is being used as an evacuation centre whenever a tsunami warning is raised. \r\nShe was in the school when the quake hit. The students went out to the school grounds, and people started coming from the town. They all stayed in the gym.  \r\nTwenty minutes after the warning, she came out to see what was happening and the valley where the town was located had already filled with water. \r\nShe said she was overwhelmed by the experience, which seemed unreal. She never expected to see something like that. Everyone in the gym was shocked, people were worried, but people also immediately tried to get help. \r\n\"It was probably the most devastating thing I've ever seen, and I didn't lose my home, I didn't possibly lose a family member. So it was just overwhelming,\" Purdy said. \r\nIn Minamisanriku, 10-thousand people are still missing, according to a government spokesman. That is nearly two-thirds of the population.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b0ccb9221681f626b0bd66c2515120f8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of Oysters that was farmed by Sato \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nResidents in the small seaside city of Shiogama in Miyagi, the prefecture that took the full impact of tsunami, face a long battle to restore their normal lives.\r\nThe city's fishermen still haven't managed to get out to sea after tsunami destroyed many of their boats and coastal radiation leaks cast a shadow on Japanese fisheries.\r\nFollowing the March 11th earthquake and tsunami, the crippled Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant has leaked radiation into the environment and radioactive water gushed into the Pacific Ocean.\r\nThis week, the government set its first-ever standard for the amount of radiation allowed in fish after levels in waters near the plant measured several million times the legal limit and elevated amounts were found in some fish.\r\nMataichi Saito, 74 year-old fisherman from Shiogama voiced the frustration of some of the fishermen from the city. \r\n\"Even if we catch fish, it is impossible for us to sell the fish because of the plant accident,\" he said.\r\nAquaculture of oyster and seaweed is also the main industry in Shiogama city, but the farms were badly destroyed by Tsunami.\r\nTomoaki Sato, 60 year-old aquaculture farmer who owns a fish shop says farmers like him need to receive help from the government.\r\nCleaning piles of rubble on the ground is making remarkable progress, but not the contaminated sea water.  \r\nAt the plant, 140 miles (220 kilometres) northeast of Tokyo, workers finally halted a leak of highly contaminated water that raised worry about the safety of seafood caught off the coast.\r\nBut even that rare good news came with a caveat. \r\nHighly contaminated water pooling around the plant has often made it difficult or impossible for workers to access some areas because of concerns about radiation exposure. \r\nThe Japanese government has announced that the government was taking the maximum allowable radiation limit for vegetables and extending it to fish.\r\nThe coastal areas hit by the 11 March tsunami make up about a fifth of Japan's huge fishing industry, but radiation fears could taint all of the country's catch through guilt by association. \r\nJapan imports far more fish than it exports, but it sent the world 2.3 (b) billion US dollars worth of seafood last year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/32798287f3a43e34c7d02e13e2edef3e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of vehicles outside evacuation centre which houses the clinic\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nA clinic in the northeastern Japanese city of Rikuzentakata was full to bursting point on Saturday with patients who need medicine, but that medicine was in short supply. \r\nThe clinic has been set up by the Japanese Red Cross to treat survivors of last week's devastating earthquake and tsunami in which an estimated more than 10-thousand people were killed.\r\nThe port city of Rikuzentakata, was home to 20-thousand people before the disaster.\r\nTetsuro Murakuni, 73, said the clinic has been his lifeline.\r\nHe needs daily medicine for high blood pressure, but the tsunami ruined most of his supply. \r\nMurakuni could not drive to the hospital as there was no gas for his car, and even if there had been, the piles of debris clogging the road would make the journey impossible.\r\n\"This clinic is very helpful for me,\" he said. \r\nTransportation between Tokyo and the tsunami zone has been disrupted, meaning supplies aren't getting to those in need fast enough.\r\nThere are two shelves stocked with various boxes of pills, and two suitcases filled with gauze, syringes and bandages. But there is hardly enough to meet demand.\r\n\"The biggest problem here is shortage of medicine,\" said Dr. Usui Tomomichi, from the Morioka Red Cross Hospital. \r\nTomomichi said it is not just the patients' physical health that is suffering, it is their mental health as well. \r\nDoctors are beginning to see a rise in both depression and anxiety.\r\n\"They've lost their house, they've lost their family members, and they survived somehow,\" said Tomomichi. \r\n\"But they'll think how am I going to live from now on?

      "description": "A symbolic landmark of the Japan's devastating tsunami - a 360-ton (330 metric ton) ship stranded inland - was shown to the media on Saturday for one last time before it is completely dismantled.\r\nIn March 2011, a magnitude 9.0 earthquake offshore of northeastern Japan, and the ensuing tsunami, killed more than 18-thousand people and devastated the coastline for hundreds of miles (kilometres).\r\nThe destruction caused by the tsunami came to be symbolised in a handful of iconic landmarks - including the 60 metre-long and 360-ton fishing vessel, the \"No.18 Kyotokumaru.\" \r\nWorkers began dismantling the stranded fishing boat early last month after a citywide vote showed the majority of the residents voted to have the ship destroyed.\r\nA non-profit organisation based in Hokkaido was contracted for the dismantling process. \r\nKazumichi Shimizu, Professor at the Muroran Institute of Technology who heads the non-profit organisation, said the dismantling process had taken longer than expected, but was nearly done.\r\n\"Within a week, most of the dismantling will be complete,\" he said.\r\nShimizu said the biggest task was to separate the large amounts of foam material used for padding in the ship's water tanks, from the scrap metal. \r\nThis will need to be done by hand.\r\nWorkers began the dismantling process last month by first pumping out fuel and oil from the ship, followed by the dismantling of the ship's wheelhouse on the upper deck, cabin interiors, and the engine room, using gas burners to tear the steel apart.\r\nCurrently, large construction cutters are being used to cut away the central section of the ship.\r\nAll this is done behind a 3-metre-high enclosure, built as a safety precaution and in consideration for local residents.\r\nAbout 500 metric tons of scrap metal from the ship will be recycled for various uses within Japan including vehicle parts, Shimizu said.\r\nThe dismantling comes after much debate among the city's residents and government officials over the fate of the \"Kyotokumaru.\"\r\nKesennuma's mayor spent the last two years urging the ship's owners to allow the city to keep the vessel as a memorial for the devastation caused by the tsunami, but neither the ship's owner, nor many of the city's residents agreed.\r\nOpinion on the ship had been so divided it had been put to a vote by the city residents in July. \r\nOf the 14,083 responses, 68 per cent, or 9,622 people, voted to have the ship destroyed. \r\nOnly 16 per cent voted to keep it.\r\nIn light of the results, in August the city announced the vessel would be torn down.\r\nToshiko Chiba, a 73-year-old resident of Kesennuma, had voted to keep the ship, saying the vessel could have served as a reminder for future generations.\r\n\"That tsunami brought such an enormous ship (inland), and so I wished that people could see the sheer strength (of the tsunami),\" she said.\r\nFor now, she keeps a postcard of the \"No.18 Kyotokumaru\" at home.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/4e00b855e82b762825ef0bbf381ffadd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of fires burning\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs Japan marks the second anniversary of a devastating earthquake and tsunami, residents of one affected city have been reflecting on the scale and complexity of the recovery effort. \r\nThe 11 March 2011 disasters, which were followed by a nuclear catastrophe, left more than 1,000 people dead in Kesennuma in Miyagi prefecture. \r\nOn Monday, a thin blanket of snow covered vast swathes of land in the city where buildings once stood. \r\nMore than 15,000 homes were either damaged or destroyed, forcing survivors to live in temporary accommodation further inland.\r\nDespite the scale of devastation, some residents hope they will be able to move back and rebuild their community - one that made its living from the fishing industry. \r\n\"The size of the community is going to be much smaller, but people who have been working in the fishing industry, the businesses, they know how to do it best here, so I think they'll stay,\" said resident Koushirou Sato.\r\nKenichi Oi, who was born in Kesennuma, runs a fishing company. \r\nThe tsunami washed away his boats in 2011, but he has since bought two new vessels and hopes to get his business up and running once again.  \r\n\"I want to give my very best, somehow, towards the reconstruction of the city,\" he said. \r\nAcross all affected areas, more than 300,000 people are still displaced and virtually no rebuilding has begun.\r\nThe government plans to spend 25 trillion yen (268 billion US dollars) for the entire reconstruction effort. \r\nHowever, less than half of the eight trillion yen (85.7 billion US dollars) allocated so far has been used.\r\nMemorial services are planned on Monday in Tokyo along the battered northeastern coast to mark the moment the magnitude-9.0 quake struck.\r\nIt was the strongest recorded in Japan's history, unleashing the massive tsunami that killed a total of nearly 19,000 people.\r\nSome 160,000 evacuees remain uncertain if they will ever be able to return to abandoned homes around the Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear power plant, where rectors melted down after the tsunami.\r\nOn Monday, about 800 people plan to file a lawsuit against the government and utility owner demanding compensation and that all land and homes be restored to their state before 11 March, 2011.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5b7007344c76a6262d64d9c6707a6c38 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "STORYLINE:\r\nA group of experts from the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) on Tuesday inspected a Japanese nuclear power plant which avoided catastrophe when it was hit by last year's tsunami.\r\nThe Onagawa plant lies just north of the now-infamous Fukushima plant that was badly damaged when it was struck by the devastating March 2011 earthquake and tsunami.\r\nThe 20-member IAEA mission, the first to visit Onagawa nuclear plant since the disaster, aims to find out the extent of the damage caused by the magnitude 9.0 quake. \r\nThree reactors at Onagawa suffered temblors that exceeded the maximum they were designed to withstand.\r\nThe basement of one of the plant's reactor buildings flooded, but the plant was able to maintain its cooling capacity. \r\nThe IAEA mission, led by seismologist Sujit Samaddar, will spend two weeks carrying out an inspection of the facilities within the compound.\r\nExperts hope their findings will help to improve nuclear safety standards around the world.\r\nLast year's tsunami caused seawater to flood the cooling system chamber, located three floors below ground level.\r\nThe pipes coming out of the wall burst and flooded the room with water levels reaching 2.5 metres (8 feet), but the damage to operations was minimal.\r\nThe anti-tsunami wall at Onagawa was built to be twice the height of what was considered necessary by its operator Tohoku Electric Power Co, which helped limit the damage.\r\nThe operator of Fukushima Dai-ichi nuclear plant, Tokyo Electric Power Co (TEPCO) has been criticised for failing to put defensive measures in place, despite a history of quakes and tsunamis in the region.\r\nA series of investigation reports, including one released earlier this month by a government-appointed panel, partly blamed a lack of foresight for the crisis.\r\nThe reports also criticised collusion among the government, regulators and TEPCO. \r\nStrong anti-nuclear sentiment has been growing in recent weeks with daily peaceful demonstrations in the capital Tokyo.\r\nBut for people living near Onagawa, one of the areas most severely devastated by the tsunami, survival and recovery take precedence.\r\n\"Who has time to worry about the nuclear power plant?\" said local fisherman Eiichi Inoue. \r\n\"The tsunami took everything we owned. We just don't have time to think about it,\" \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/00962d1d9b3ea095360c4004c5370b04 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

I was standing outside of my rented car when the quake initially struck and it was nearly impossible to remain standing, but over the next 3-minutes I was able to get back to the car to retrieve my camera and began documenting the shaking.  Without hesitation, I immediately sought a high point as a vertical shelter in case of a tsunami - that decision saved my life!  I documented the resulting tsunami from atop of a hill that overlooked Otsuchi Harbor.  This is a small percentage of the entire video that I recorded.",

      "description": "Introduction to Thought Field Therapy (TFT) an early treatment utilizing acupressure for the mind and emotions.  The video provides some information on how TFT started and how powerful it is as a treatment for phobias, anxiety, trauma and panic attacks.  This is one of the therapy methods that Steve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT uses to treat people in the Dallas, Plano, Richardson, Texas and DFW area.\n\nVideo Transcript:\nTFT, 2003, www.psychotherapy-center.com\nFirst, I probably need to go back to the work\nof Dr. Roger Callahan who developed a method\ncall all Thought Field Therapy\nTFT was one of the first acupressure\nbased interventions to help people\nalleviate mental and emotional distress.\nin fact all the work talking about today\nmight  neatly fall under the title of\nacupressure for the mind and emotions.\nIn fact this is radically different paradigm\nfor treating mental and\nemotional distress. In traditional therapies,\ncognitive interventions, basically trying to change the way people\nthink about a problem has been utilized.  Behavioral interventions, changing\nthe way one behaves has been utilized, and other techniques as well.\nSteve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT.  But this is a very new\nway of looking at intervening upon mental and emotional distress.\nStart of TFT.  In the late 70s, Dr.\nRoger Callahan was exposed to\nsome work that some chiropractors were doing.  And they had begun to experiment \nwith the use of\nacupuncture, rather than acupuncture, \nactually just a gentle pressure or tapping on the acupuncture point\nrather than using needles, to try to intervene at an\nemotional level. A friend of his invited him to a demonstration\nand he was actually quite impressed with what he saw.\nHe took some training and\nbegin to work on his own then to experiment with and\nexplore the development of a method which\neventually became Thought Field Therapy.\nStory of Mary.  One of the stories that he told when I took\ntraining with him a number of years ago was about\na lady named Mary that he work with.  Mary was an\nindividually who had a tremendous fear of water.\nShe'd had this fear\nwater as long as she could remember.  She did not like\nto bathe in it.  She did not like to look at it.  She didn't like to \ndrink it. She really wanted nothing\nto do water.  Dr. Callahan\ntried cognitive therapy with her, he'd been a cognitive therapist\nfor 40 years and I think he had worked at Albert Ellis's Cognitive therapy \ninstitute in Chicago . But \nhe had attempted cognitive therapy as an intervention\nand that wasn't working.  So\nhe then was trying a behavioral\nintervention system referred to as systematic desensitization.\nIt is a fairly simple idea.  It's a technique in \nwhich one behaviorally, gradually, begins to approach something\nthat they feel a sense of fear about and at the\npoint that the fear begins to rise, they will do some\nrelaxation exercises to try to restore a state of\nrelaxation.  The basic idea is that fear and tension\nand relaxation are mutually exclusive and cannot exist\nat the same place at the same time.  So if you can get a person\nrelaxed enough that can help actually desensitize\ntheir overly\nsensitive response to the object of their fear. He had\ninvited Mary to his home where he had a large swimming pool.\nAnd the protocol was to see how close she could\nwalk toward the swimming pool before\nthat state of fear would begin to\ncome upon her.  Well, he'd never gotten her within\n20 feet of it basically. And it really wasn't going very well\nso he was at his wits end.  And he asked her, he said, \nMary would you be willing to try something\na little different like an experiment.  \nShe said, sure Dr. Callahan, I'd be glad to.  I'll try anything. \nAnd what he asked her to do \nwas to hold an acupressure point. A spot just\nbelow the eyes on the\nupper part of the cheekbone.  And he asked her to\nhold that and to gently tap it while\nshe thought about her fear of water.  She did so, and\nthat went on for a few minutes. And then all of a sudden\nhe reported that she stopped and said that's weird.\nAnd he said what's weird?  And she says, that feeling\nthat I get in my stomach when I feel this fear of \nwater, it's not there.  While Dr. Callahan\nwas thinking about this, she gets up and\nbolts toward the swimming pool.  Now that freaked him out.\nHe thought, oh my gosh, it looks like she's going to jump in.\nHis first thought was, Mary you can't swim stop.  He yelled\nthat out and she just broke down laughing.  She says Dr. Callahan,\nI'm no I can't swim.  I \nhaven't lost my mind, but she said\nI may have lost my fear.  And she went and\nliterally sat down by the pool, and he reported that she dropped\nher feet in and splashed her feet in the pool like a little kid.\nAt that moment she did lose her fear and never had\nanother moment of panic or\nfear or any other phobic responses about water from that point forward.\nSteve B. Reed, LPC, LMSW, LMFT\n 375 Municipal Drive, Suite 230, Richardson, Texas 75080",

      "description": "Jesus spoke to them again in parables, saying,\n\"The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a king who gave a wedding feast for his son.\n\"And he sent out his slaves to call those who had been invited to the wedding feast, and they were unwilling to come.\n\"Again he sent out other slaves saying, 'Tell those who have been invited, \"Behold, I have prepared my dinner; my oxen and my fattened livestock are all butchered and everything is ready; come to the wedding feast.\"'\n\"But they paid no attention and went their way, one to his own farm, another to his business,\nand the rest seized his slaves and mistreated them and killed them.\n\"But the king was enraged, and he sent his armies and destroyed those murderers and set their city on fire.\n\"Then he said to his slaves, 'The wedding is ready, but those who were invited were not worthy.\n'Go therefore to the main highways, and as many as you find there, invite to the wedding feast.'\n\"Those slaves went out into the streets and gathered together all they found, both evil and good; and the wedding hall was filled with dinner guests.\n\"But when the king came in to look over the dinner guests, he saw a man there who was not dressed in wedding clothes,\nand he said to him, 'Friend, how did you come in here without wedding clothes?' And the man was speechless.\n\"Then the king said to the servants, 'Bind him hand and foot, and throw him into the outer darkness; in that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth.'\n\"For many are called, but few are chosen.\"\nThen the Pharisees went and plotted together how they might trap Him in what He said.\nAnd they sent their disciples to Him, along with the Herodians, saying, \"Teacher, we know that You are truthful and teach the way of God in truth, and defer to no one; for You are not partial to any.\n\"Tell us then, what do You think? Is it lawful to give a poll-tax to Caesar, or not?\"\nBut Jesus perceived their malice, and said, \"Why are you testing Me, you hypocrites?\n\"Show Me the coin used for the poll-tax.\" And they brought Him a denarius.\nAnd He said to them, \"Whose likeness and inscription is this?\"\nThey said to Him, \"Caesar's.\" Then He said to them, \"Then render to Caesar the things that are Caesar's; and to God the things that are God's.\"\nAnd hearing this, they were amazed, and leaving Him, they went away.\nOn that day some Sadducees (who say there is no resurrection) came to Jesus and questioned Him,\nasking, \"Teacher, Moses said, 'IF A MAN DIES HAVING NO CHILDREN, HIS BROTHER AS NEXT OF KIN SHALL MARRY HIS WIFE, AND RAISE UP CHILDREN FOR HIS BROTHER.'\n\"Now there were seven brothers with us; and the first married and died, and having no children left his wife to his brother;\nso also the second, and the third, down to the seventh.\n\"Last of all, the woman died.\n\"In the resurrection, therefore, whose wife of the seven will she be? For they all had married her.\"\nBut Jesus answered and said to them, \"You are mistaken, not understanding the Scriptures nor the power of God.\n\"For in the resurrection they neither marry nor are given in marriage, but are like angels in heaven.\n\"But regarding the resurrection of the dead, have you not read what was spoken to you by God:\n'I AM THE GOD OF ABRAHAM, AND THE GOD OF ISAAC, AND THE GOD OF JACOB'? He is not the God of the dead but of the living.\"\nWhen the crowds heard this, they were astonished at His teaching.\nBut when the Pharisees heard that Jesus had silenced the Sadducees, they gathered themselves together.\nOne of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, testing Him,\n\"Teacher, which is the great commandment in the Law?\"\nAnd He said to him, \" 'YOU SHALL LOVE THE LORD YOUR GOD WITH ALL YOUR HEART, AND WITH ALL YOUR SOUL, AND WITH ALL YOUR MIND.'\n\"This is the great and foremost commandment.\n\"The second is like it, 'YOU SHALL LOVE YOUR NEIGHBOR AS YOURSELF.'\n\"On these two commandments depend the whole Law and the Prophets.\"\nNow while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question:\n\"What do you think about the Christ, whose son is He?\" They said to Him, \"The son of David.\"\nHe said to them, \"Then how does David in the Spirit call Him 'Lord,' saying,\n'THE LORD SAID TO MY LORD, \"SIT AT MY RIGHT HAND, UNTIL I PUT YOUR ENEMIES BENEATH YOUR FEET\"'?\n\"If David then calls Him 'Lord,' how is He his son?\"\nNo one was able to answer Him a word, nor did anyone dare from that day on to ask Him another question.\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

Which is more important, the gold or the temple that sanctified the gold?\n\"And, 'Whoever swears by the altar, that is nothing, but whoever swears by the offering on it, he is obligated.'\n\"You blind men, which is more important, the offering, or the altar that sanctifies the offering?\n\"Therefore, whoever swears by the altar, swears both by the altar and by everything on it.\n\"And whoever swears by the temple, swears both by the temple and by Him who dwells within it.\n\"And whoever swears by heaven, swears both by the throne of God and by Him who sits upon it.\n\"Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, hypocrites!

Come, see the place where He was lying.\n\"Go quickly and tell His disciples that He has risen from the dead; and behold, He is going ahead of you into Galilee, there you will see Him; behold, I have told you.\"\nAnd they left the tomb quickly with fear and great joy and ran to report it to His disciples.\nAnd behold, Jesus met them and greeted them. And they came up and took hold of His feet and worshiped Him.\nThen Jesus said to them, \"Do not be afraid; go and take word to My brethren to leave for Galilee, and there they will see Me.\"\nNow while they were on their way, some of the guard came into the city and reported to the chief priests all that had happened.\nAnd when they had assembled with the elders and consulted together, they gave a large sum of money to the soldiers,\nand said, \"You are to say, 'His disciples came by night and stole Him away while we were asleep.'\n\"And if this should come to the governor's ears, we will win him over and keep you out of trouble.\"\nAnd they took the money and did as they had been instructed; and this story was widely spread among the Jews, and is to this day.\nBut the eleven disciples proceeded to Galilee, to the mountain which Jesus had designated.\nWhen they saw Him, they worshiped Him; but some were doubtful.\nAnd Jesus came up and spoke to them, saying, \"All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.\n\"Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,\nteaching them to observe all that I commanded you; and lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age.\"\n\nFor The Entire Text and or Images: www.reachmorenow.com\n\nRay: raymossholder@gmail.com\n        http://holyhugsray.blogspot.com/\n        https://www.facebook.com/ray.mossholder\n\nLarry: larrymjackii@gmail.com\n          https://twitter.com/LarryJack2\n          http://larryjack.blogspot.com/\n          https://www.facebook.com/LarryJackII",

      "description": "\"Nature in our Backyard: The Trinity River & Great Trinity Forest\"\n\nFine photographic prints by Dan Burkholder, Scot Miller, Jill Skupin Burkholder & R.P. Washburne\n\nJune 25 – August 22, 2015\n\nThe Trinity River and Great Trinity Forest have been receiving much attention, for a variety of reasons, but it’s no secret that the river dominated the spotlight recently. Thousands flocked to its banks to experience the sights of the flood waters. However, the reality is most people know little about the true nature of river and forest as they exist year-round. Sun to Moon Gallery and four talented photographers have worked to change that. For ten years now, the photographers have spent time on and along the river and in and around the forest, including many beautiful but lesser-known areas, creatively interpreting with their cameras. In the process, they have created an ever-expanding and changing body of work that includes engaging new photographs of the flooded Trinity by Scot Miller and R.P. Washburne.\n\nFrom vivid digitally captured images, to stunning detail studies with film and a medium-format camera, to bromoil prints overlaid with color pigments, to 24k Gold Leaf Prints and more; a wide range of subject matter, artistic expression and photographic techniques form the basis of this eye-opening exhibition. Sun to Moon Gallery invites the public to come, be inspired, and see the river, forest and city in a new light!\n\nNew short films by Scot Miller –\n\nScot Miller, a contributor to the “Moment in Nature” videos, broadcast nationally on Emmy Award-winning CBS Sunday Morning, also spent many hours and days over the past months capturing stunning 4k video footage of the river and forest, including many time sequences. He has created several short films, including one featuring the floods, that will be screened in the gallery throughout the exhibition.",

      "description": "It fell into my heart about two weeks ago to write you this letter. I sat down right away to do it but to me it felt superficial, and not really from my heart, so I put it on the back burner until now.\n\nThen I was awakened from sleep and the words began to come to me concerning what I really wanted to say, so I came to jot them down.\n\nI recently watched a video of a shepherdess caring for her sheep... she led them to good pasture where they grazed till their hearts were content. That's what canDEElicious Video Ministry is all about... preparing ground for you to graze on. Come over here the table is spread and the feast of the Lord is going on.\n\nIn the video there were also baby lambs that the shepherdess fed with a milk bottle, reminding me of Jesus' words to Peter, \"Feed My Lambs.\"\n\nAlthough the Lord did not call me to be a shepherd, He made me a hireling to feed His sheep and His  little lambs. With all my heart, I want to do my best and be a worthy vessel for His use. When you watch these videos, I want the Lord to touch your hearts and bring you a sense that He is speaking directly to you.\n\nHeb 4:12 says the word of God is a discerner of the thoughts and intents of the heart. That's why it sounds like He is speaking directly to you.\n\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\n\nLately, I've been feeling like such a failure at living up to His calling and election. My attitude toward God and misunderstanding His will for my life has left me wanting.\n\nOne of the things that I never want to happen as I teach God's word to others is that I myself would not live up to it through my disobedience and obstinance.\n\nA few years ago, I was so offended with God that I refused to pray. Prayer didn't seem practical because my expectations were not being met. So I weaned off. There were times when the Holy Spirit would unction me to pray and I would kindly decline, \"No thank You.\" I didn't feel mad at God. Prayer just simply felt impractical so I failed to maintain a good prayer life.\n\nBut I woke up one morning the The Temptations fell in my heart and I couldn't shake it... \n\nI can fly like a bird in the sky\nAnd I can buy anything money can buy\nI can turn a river into a raging fire\nI can live forever if I so desire\nUnimportant are all the things I can do\nCause I can't get next to babe\nCan't get next to you.\n\nI felt that I had let my Lord down feeding Him from a long-handled spoon. He was knocking at the door of my heart but my pride kept me at a distance. But I thought it was so sweet that He said with all of His power to do anything He wants to do - the one thing escaping Him was getting me to open up.\n\nJesus said, \"Behold I stand at the door and knock. If anyone hears My voice and opens the door, I will come in to him and dine with him, and he with Me.\"\n\nGod's love is poured out in our hearts by the Holy Spirit but we must first open our hearts to Him and invite Him in (or back in, if He's been pushed aside).\n\nPerhaps today you have decided that you want to get closer to the Lord. Reach out to Him, let Him right the wrongs. He said His grace is sufficient... and He is strong where we are weak.\n\nLet God arise and His enemies be scattered. Submit yourselves to God, resist the devil and he will flee from you.\n\nThank you, our Subscribers. We're praying for you and sincerely hoping these Bible teachings are helping you. We'll see you again soon.\n\nMay God bless and keep you and make His face shine upon you and be gracious to you. May the Lord lift up His countenance upon you and give you His peace.\n\nBlog: http://richardsonblogger.blogspot.com/",

      "description": "Village Tech Schools, a charter school serving grades pre-K through 12, is in the design stage of their new permanent campus to be located near Belt Line Road in Cedar Hill's historic downtown. WRA Architects of Dallas is designing the school, and Northstar Builders of Coppell has been selected as the Construction Manager, or builder.\n\"We are thrilled to partner with WRA and the City of Cedar Hill on this exciting new project,\" said David Williams, Village Tech's founder and CEO. \"When we're finished, the school will enclose 168,000 square feet in four separate buildings and will serve up to 1,040 students.\"\nThe four structures include a 3-story classroom building for grades 3-12, a preschool for grades PreK-2, a gymnasium and dining building, and \"the Forge.\"\nThe Forge is the heart of the school and embodies Village Tech's educational philosophy. It includes maker spaces, art studios, computer labs, and presentation and demonstration space. This is where students from all grade levels will design and construct projects that relate to and illustrate their curriculum in all core subjects.\nKeith Anderson, AIA, is WRA's director of design and principal-in-charge of the project. He commented, \"Village Tech has a wonderfully innovative approach to education, and working with them on bringing their vision to life on a new campus has been very exciting for our design team.\"\nThe campus will be one of the first projects in the redevelopment of Cedar Hill's urban center and hopes to be a catalyst for further development of this area. The school will hold its \"Home of Tomorrow\" preview of the new campus on the future school site at 100 Carrell Street in Cedar Hill on Saturday, December 12, from 11 am to 2 pm.\nConstruction will start in mid-2016.",

      "title": "Texas Tempting Fate?? by Going for 'Open Carry' Handguns?",
      "description": "The slippery slope to jungle-mentality has begun with the Texas push for open-carry guns.  Even closed-carry should be outlawed. Just who does Texas expect to shoot.  Most of the victims will be people who piss you off because of road-rage, or maybe even the lady who cuts in front of you at the supermarket?  Shoot first, think later.  \nOnly police and military who are well-trained, should have this authority.\n\nThe proprietors of Gringo's Mexican Kitchen are old hands at standing up to the common difficulties of an expanding eatery business—enlisting, rivalry, notwithstanding building up a \"gluten guide.\" But as of late the Tex-Mex chain has been confronting an uncommon problem: whether to permit clients to transparently show their weapons while crunching fajitas. \n\nCome Jan. 1, authorized guns proprietors in Texas will have the capacity to straightforwardly convey a handgun in many spots. A law marked by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott prior this year will make Texas the most crowded state in the U.S. to permit the practice, known as \"open convey.\" \n\nExisting Texas law requires authorized firearm proprietors to hide their handguns so they aren't on display. The new law will permit them to convey handguns straightforwardly, in belt or bear holsters. \n\nYet, private organizations and different foundations have the privilege to boycott open convey under the law, and numerous have been grappling with how to continue. \n\n\"We're essentially a family domain as far as our eatery. Thus we chose it's presumably best not to permit open convey,\" said Al Flores, counsel for Gringo's, which has 14 eateries, predominantly in the Houston zone and encompassing regions. \"We recently felt that knowing our clients, permitting somebody to stroll in straightforwardly conveying a weapon, it would make them feel somewhat uncomfortable.\" \n\nFlores said the eatery network will post signs in English and Spanish, cautioning clients about the denial. A hid firearm would in any case be allowed at Gringo's. \n\nOthers have taken an alternate tack. In the first place Baptist Church of Arlington, close Dallas, which commonly sees somewhere in the range of 2,500 admirers every Sunday, will permit open convey. \n\nSenior Pastor Dennis Wiles said the congregation went to its choice in the wake of talking about the matter with its legitimate group—notwithstanding attendees, including cops who as of now convey disguised weapons. \n\n\"We chose it was best to permit dependable individuals to do this on the off chance that they pick,\" Mr. Wiles said. \"We will likely evaluate the circumstance in two or three months to perceive how it goes. With regards to a congregation, I don't believe we're going to see that much distinction.\nhttp://www.foxnews.com/us/2015/12/27/texas-gears-up-for-new-open-carry-handgun-law.html?intcmp=trending",

The team has responded to natural disasters in Haiti and the Philippines and those experiences have built a special expertise. But Nepal was a bit different: A team of Stanford emergency medicine physicians had been there to work with Nepalis to create the first Nepalese ambulance service. The recent earthquake was a proverbial trial by fire for the service, which remains the only functioning ambulance service in the country. In this video, Auerbach shares his observations—and his feelings about what he saw and the people of Nepal.\n\nDiscover more at:\nwww.stanfordhealthcare.org",

      "description": "Unique historical pre-disaster and San Francisco earthquake aftermath footage.\n\nThe 1906 San Francisco earthquake struck the coast of Northern California at 5:12 a.m. on Wednesday, April 18. Devastating fires broke out in the city that lasted for several days. As a result, about 3,000 people died and over 80% of San Francisco was destroyed.\n\nThe earthquake and resulting fire are remembered as one of the worst natural disasters in the history of the United States alongside the Galveston Hurricane of 1900 and Hurricane Katrina in 2005. The death toll from the earthquake and resulting fire remains the greatest loss of life from a natural disaster in California's history. At the time, 375 deaths were reported. Partly because hundreds of fatalities in Chinatown went ignored and unrecorded, the total number of deaths is still uncertain today, and is estimated to be roughly 3,000 at minimum. Most of the deaths occurred in San Francisco itself, but 189 were reported elsewhere in the Bay Area; nearby cities, such as Santa Rosa and San Jose, also suffered severe damage. Between 227,000 and 300,000 people were left homeless out of a population of about 410,000; half of those who evacuated fled across the bay to Oakland and Berkeley. Newspapers described Golden Gate Park, the Presidio, the Panhandle and the beaches between Ingleside and North Beach as covered with makeshift tents. More than two years later, many of these refugee camps were still in operation.\n\nSF Cable cars\nAndrew Smith Hallidie tested the first cable car at 4 o'clock in the morning, August 2nd, 1873, on Clay Street, in San Francisco. His idea for a steam engine powered - cable driven - rail system was conceived in 1869, after witnessing horses being whipped while they struggled on the wet cobblestones to pull a horsecar up Jackson Street. Hallidie entered into a partnership to form the Clay Street Hill Railroad, which began construction of a cable line on Clay Street in May of 1873. The contract to operate on city streets stated the line must be operational by August 1st. They launched on the 2nd. Even though they were a day late the cable car trials received great approval. Clay Street Hill Railroad began public service on September 1st, 1873. It was a tremendous success. Clay Street Hill Railroad was the sole cable car company for 4 years. A former horsecar company, Sutter Street Railroad, developed its own version of Hallidie's patented system and began cable service in 1877, followed by California Street Cable Railroad -1878, Geary Street, Park & Ocean Railroad -1880, Presidio & Ferries Railroad -1882, Market Street Cable Railway -1883, Ferries & Cliff House Railway -1888, and Omnibus Railroad & Cable Company -1889.\n\nAll totaled San Francisco companies had lay down 53 miles of track stretching from the Ferry Building to the Presidio, to Golden Gate Park, to the Castro, to the Mission.\nApril 18, 1906, the Great Earthquake & Fire devastated the city.\nBy this time the electric streetcar, perfected in1888 by Frank Sprague, had become the vehicle of choice for city transit. It only required half the investment to build and maintain, could reach more areas and was quicker. The cable cars were still able to traverse the steep hills better, so some of the lines were rebuilt.

      "description": "What's #1 here is trying to save LA. The once-Preemie grew up quick. It is Him. Good news is that He is trimming it back to Point Loma only!\n\nCalled to be an oracle in 1986 Roger Hefferan abandoned a hefty political career three weeks after the US attacked Tripoli and Benghazi to keep the U.S. from invading Libya based on CIA Disinformation. Ergo, Washington's \"Watchdog Oracle\"..\n\nAs an oracle he warns California now of the 6-6-6 Beast.  Spirit Mountain was the first to identify the 6-6-6 Beast in conjunction with this upcoming disaster, and just now (1-25-16) they have elevated \"Point Loma\" to a San Diego-wide catastrophe.\n\nUPDATE 2/21/2016, including succinct summary and INDEX to all 24 Posts since May 2015 on the Preemie topic: \nhttps://www.linkedin.com/pulse/reader...\n\nComplete URL ends like this: ...pulse/readers-guide-roger-hefferan\n\nArranged: Christopher Miles, MAGICAL BLEND.\nProduced,: Diana Marie May.\nPress Coverage  beneath Summary in Background on LinkedIn Profile.\nSEE: https://www.linkedin.com/in/hefferan2015\n\nThis 1986 revelation came from accurate non-human sources, i.e. his \"channeling\" of JFK. Whether or not one likes the content of the speech, that the information and the \"speaker\" came through the paranormal is clear. Shamanic means allowed such an altered state to be attained that \"JFK could present his views through me as me.\"\n\n SECRET documents of one aspect went to Paul Rauber,  EAST BAY EXPRESS (beard and glasses) for the June 20, 1986, edition of that weekly (included in Press Coverage), exposing CIA Disinformation. Roger  left job and career to hide with Native Americans to stay out of jail.\n\nFive months later Teddy Kennedy got the Washington Post to run a White House admission that  lies were  planted in the Wall Street Journal, run as\"Truth About Qaddafi\" for a year to justify attack.\n\n\nSTATEMENT BY: Michael Ussery, Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, Near East Asian, 1985-88:\n\n\"I wrote the plan, and I had moral compunction against trying to topple Qaddafi at almost any price, and so I sent it to Howard Teicher and Dennis Ross at the National Security Council.  They loved it.\n\"Howard decided that he would rewrite it, just edit it really; but one of the edits was Howard didn’t think and didn’t understand the idea of the disinformation messages that we’d bombard into Libya. He added a phrase in there that was disinformation “including through the American media,” including like planting stories in The Wall Street Journal or something like that.\"\n\nhttp://adst.org/2013/04/crossing-qadd...\n\n\nChicago was \"targeted\" with a pseudo-nuke to trigger Invasion Hysteria, as Op. Bouquet following Ops Flower, Daisy & Rose all year.\nPress Coverage: FedEx 10/28; Mayor10/29; El Rukns arrest 10/30; SunTimes 10/31\n\nWHY BRING THIS UP NOW?\nCalifornia must elect an extreme paranormal solution. \n\n\nPOINT LOMA EARTHQUAKE VERY SOON FROM 6-6-6 BEAST BUT  NO DATE FIXED\nThis was avoidable by the Venice Project.\n\nLA EARTHQUAKE +90 DAYS  FROM 6-6-6 BEAST:\nSomething 100x worse would hit LA  but for 2 THINGS: \n[1]  Point Loma will be a wake-up call. \n[2] Even so, \"in full swing\" in 90 days hard because of Yale's Book & Snake\"\nHowever, Spirit does offer to trade 90-days for funding Ocean Saving NGOs.\n\n\nOTHER SIGNIFICANT REVELATIONS WITH POLITICAL IMPACT\nIn October 1992 I provided Clinton Texas HQ with GEORGE BUSH::THE SELL-OUT OF AMERICA showing that GHWB \"threw\"​ the 1971 UN vote to admit PRC.\nGHWB \"threw\" the next debate, the Town Hall debate by ripping off his glasses, then studying his wristwatch,  thereby \"throwing\" the  election and hiding the PRC-into-UN vote.\n\nYears later Nixon Tapes confirmed that GHWB \"threw\" the vote. \n\nSEE Nixon Tapes:  12-31-1971, 9:24 p.m., Nixon telephoned GHWB to congratulate him for a successful year at the UN. \n\nLISTEN: GHWB argues: \"Everything but one thing, Sir,\" still faking his FAILURE b/c they slipped up the vote and it got away from him\n\nHEAR NIXON SAY \"No, no, everything.\" CONFIRMING that GHWB threw the UN vote to admit the PRC, since Australia, Britan & Canada voted PRC in..\nhttp://nixontapes.org/presidents.html\n\n\n\nOUTSIDE VERIFICATION OF PSYCHIC INPUT:\n8-8: Project turned over to Edward Cayce's A.R.E., \"Association for Research and Enlightenment\"\n8-10:  A.R.E. \"lacks funding\" to implement it.\n12-11: Nothing further\n\n\nTHE OTHER OVERWHELMING ISSUE:\n\nTypical Bush Disinformation Dynasty response would be to try to label this a hoax,\n\n Hoax disinformation would sabotage the Venice Project, since a HAPPY Walking Parvati was specified by the Holy Ghost.\n\nConfirmation from A.R.E. could have SAVED Point Loma by snuffing possibility of hoax talk\n\nMeantime LA must put together the Venice Project  ASAP.\n\n\n11-17: Timothy E.

      "description": "6915/A: SAN FRANCISCO: WILL THE QUAKE COME?\r\n\r\nSan Francisco is situated on a major geological fault,\r\nand over the past twelve months or so scientists have\r\nbecome increasingly worried by the threat of another\r\nearthquake of the same magnitude that destroyed the\r\ncity back in 1906.  One rather wild notion current in the\r\narea at the moment is that the whole Californian\r\nseaboard could just slide away into the Pacific.  The\r\nscientists are a good deal less pessimistic than that,\r\nbut there does seem to be cause for concern.  We\r\nvisited San Francisco, and nearby Hollister, \"earth\r\nquake capital of the nation\", and interviewed three\r\nscientists:  Karl Steinbrugge, a world authority on\r\nstructural damage caused by earthquakes; Richard\r\nJahns, Dean of Stanford University School of Earth\r\nSciences; and Doctor Don Tocker of the Earth Movement\r\nLaboratories in San Francisco.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/841104b5233f08bbaedc93715db05c59 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "This video report will show the ritual 911 code contained in the recent Shepard Smith, FOX TV media report, regarding a coming major earthquake, that will create a tsunami and impact the North West Coast of California and more.\n\nAt present I still do not want to discuss or speak to anyone, so for those that need someone to explain what is there to see in this ritual code observation,, you will have to catch me at a better time, for I am at present in no quick hurry to talk or willing to explain anything to anyone.\n\nStop the video to ponder the charts if they move too fast and I would tell you that the only reason I did this video, was to affirm for others that this event was in fact a coded 911 future event, that needs to be seen and discussed among yourselves.\n\nThis Shepard - FOX report clearly suggests that 7-23, 7-24 and 7-25 are going to be used in some false flag event.  I reveal this observation, only to re-burden the NWO with their event karma, that is no longer secret or hidden.\n\nThe code is present for all to see and I would hope that you ponder the code and numbers at your leisure.  I am just at present not willing to engage in any discussion, because of my current state of mind.\n\nI am trying to get back on my feet, but it is much harder than I could have imagined.  Thank you all for your patience and understanding.\n\nHeads up.  911 events have been planned and I hope to have exposed their plans based on the disclosure of their coded material fused into the FOX report.\n\nBackground Sources and Links:\nhttp://video.foxnews.com/v/4356513070001/report-mega-quake-could-kill-13000-in-pacific-northwest/?#sp=show-clips\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This video contains copyrighted material.

      "description": "Japan Tsunami 2011 - Tohoku Earthquake Shocking Video\n\nAn erupting volcanic island that is expanding off Japan could trigger a tsunami if its freshly-formed lava slopes collapse into the sea, scientists say.\n\nThe small, but growing, island appeared last year and quickly engulfed the already-existing island of Nishinoshima, around 1000 kilometres south of Tokyo.\n\nIt now covers 1.26 square kilometres.\n\nThe island's craters are currently spewing out 200,000 cubic metres of lava every day - enough to fill 80 Olympic swimming pools - which is accumulating in its east, scientists said.\n\n\"If lava continues to mount on the eastern area, part of the island's slopes could collapse and cause a tsunami,\" warned Fukashi Maeno, assistant professor of the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo.\n\nHe said a rockfall of 12 million cubic metres of lava would generate a one metre tsunami that could travel faster than a bullet train, hitting the island of Chichijima - 130kms away - in around 18 minutes, he said.\n\nChichijima, home to about 2000 people, is the largest island in the Ogasawara archipelago, a wild and remote chain that is administratively part of Tokyo.\n\n\"The ideal way to monitor and avoid a natural disaster is to set up a new tsunami and earthquake detection system near the island, but it's impossible for anyone to land on the island in the current situation,\" Maeno added.\n\nAn official from the Japan Meteorological Agency, which monitors earthquakes and tsunamis, said the agency is watching for any signs of anything untoward.\n\n\"We studied the simulation this morning, and we are thinking of consulting with earthquake prediction experts ... about the probability of this actually happening, and what kind of measures we would be able to take,\" he said.\n\nJapan's northeast was ravaged by a huge tsunami in March 2011, when a massive undersea earthquake sent a wall of water barrelling into the northeast coast, killing more than 18,000 people and wrecking whole towns.\n\nLink Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmGm8PlHnXs",

Black & white footage of ruins of San Francisco following earthquake\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nSirens wailed through the city before dawn in San Francisco on Tuesday marking the moment 100 years earlier when the Great Quake shattered the city, killing thousands as it levelled buildings and touched off fires that burned for days.\r\nA handful of centenarians who survived that devastation joined hundreds of residents for a moment of silence and a memorial ceremony to remember one of the worst natural disasters in U.S. history.\r\nMost of the city''s 400,000 residents were still in bed when the magnitude-7.8 earthquake struck at 5:12 a.m. on April 18, 1906.\r\nThe epicentre was a few miles (kilometres) offshore of the city, but it was felt as far away as Oregon and Nevada. \r\nFrom cracked chimneys, broken gas lines and toppled chemical tanks, fires broke out and swept across the city, burning for days. \r\nRuptured water pipes left firefighters helpless, while families carrying what they could fled to parks that had become makeshift morgues.\r\nOne hundred eleven year old Mildred Morganstein remembers the hardships that befell her family and neighbours immediately following the quake.\r\nBut they disagree over whether people should love the city or leave it.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f80574dcaa53f2994473516cd8dac056 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

With this location, the area where I have shot video of these strange objects has grown to a pretty large footprint.

SOUNDBITE: (English) Walter Alexander, former co-defendant: (++partially overlaid with close shot of Simpson++) \r\nUPSOUND (English): David Roger, District Attorney, Clark County:  \r\n\"What did he (OJ Simpson) tell you he needed you to do?\"\r\nA: \"Once he, after he had asked me if we could watch his back, he kinda leaned forward and it was like, 'hey, do you think you can get some heat? Do you think you can get some heat, you know, just in case things go wrong. Just in case, you know, they may have heat, you know, can you bring some heat?'\r\nQ:  What did that mean to you? \r\nA:\"That meant that he wanted me to help him acquire some guns.\"\r\n4. Mid of Simpson and attorney\r\n5. SOUNDBITE: (English) Walter Alexander, former co-defendant:\r\n\"Mr. Simpson asked Spencer (Michael\"Spencer\" McClinton) to put the gun in his hand. He said, 'put the gun in your hand.' It changed the whole plan, cause at first the plan was that we were supposed to just show the guns, but right before we went in the room, he did tell Spencer to put his gun in his hand.\"\r\nQ: \"And Spencer did that?\"  \r\nA: \"Yes, he did. So when he walked in that's why he already had it out and he was, you know, making commands.\" \r\n6. Mid of Simpson\r\n7. Mid of David Roger, District Attorney \r\n8. Mid of Simpson\r\n9.  Mid of Alexander UPSOUND: (English) Yale Galanter, OJ Simpson's attorney: (off camera)\r\n\"Certainly, Tom Scotto (Simpson's friend) didn't need your help, right?\"\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) Walter Alexander, former co-defendant:\r\nA:\"That's true.\"  \r\nQ: \"What you're implying in this message is that you would give favourable testimony to Mr. Simpson if Mr. Scotto wrote you a check, or helped you out with bail, and lawyers, so on and so forth? Isn't that correct, sir?\"\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English)  Walter Alexander, former co-defendant:\r\nA: \"Not true.\"\r\nQ: \"Not true?  Would you like to hear it again?\"\r\nSOUNDBITE: (English) Walter Alexander, former co-defendant:\r\n\"No. I can tell you what I was saying. That's not what it says on there. What I was saying is that what I would say in court could definitely, you know, I really felt that he was set up. So, I felt like I could lean toward that angle rather than telling the exact truth.\"\r\n10. Cutaway of Simpson smiling\r\n11. Mid of Alexander on the stand \r\n12. Lawyer checking notes\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nO.J. Simpson's one-time golfing friend glared at him across a courtroom on Tuesday and said the former football star wanted him to bring \"heat\", a gun, to a confrontation with two sports memorabilia dealers in a Las Vegas hotel room.\r\nMinutes later, Simpson's lawyer accused the friend, Walter Alexander, of being a liar, and the two wound up in a shouting match in the third day of a preliminary hearing in the armed robbery case.\r\nA justice of the peace will decide after the hearing whether there is enough evidence for Simpson and two other men to stand trial.\r\nAlexander's testimony was the strongest for prosecutors so far. He and Michael McClinton, who also testified against Simpson on Tuesday, struck deals with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to lesser charges, as did Charles Cashmore, who testified last week.\r\n\"After he asked me if I could watch his back, he leaned forward and it was kind of like, 'Hey, do you think you can get some heat?\"' Alexander said. \"'Just in case things go wrong, can you bring some heat?\"'\r\nSimpson, 60, has maintained in interviews and through his lawyers that he never saw any guns or asked anyone to bring them to the hotel room. \r\nHe sometimes smiled but frequently shook his head as Alexander testified.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c48385adcb1f15fb10325bc93671a292 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "This video was captured in the northern mountains of the Las Vegas Valley on the night of September 15, 2015.\n\nI am an average guy and no different than your next door neighbor, your brother, dad or uncle, but I have come to a point where I have to ask the question. Why me? Why is this happening? I don't know of anyone anywhere that has compiled even a fraction of what I am compiling on video and even in some photos. Sometimes I am just taking photos and they are there. UFOs showing up when I go places. What does this all mean and how could it even be possible? I think I have a pretty pure heart, but there's nothing special about me. I love all the good people of the world no matter what their race or social standing is but I am not even remotely religious and I don't believe in spirits and spooks. I detest and kind of violence and partisan politics. I respect everybody I meet until they prove they aren't worth of my respect. It's all about the children of the world and fairness. Nobody pounded anything into my head while I was growing up and I made my own rules and choices. The rules were simple and basically came down to what's right and what's wrong and how I should treat others. I am not dumb, but I am no genius either. I just don't get it. How could it be that I may end up having the distinction of being the most prolific UFO hunter in the world? I do have to ask this question! This particular video just blows me away just like many others I have and yet I am shunned and ignored by all the so called experts who could help. What are they afraid of? Why won't they even speak to me or take the time to investigate my videos? It doesn't make any sense.",

I aimed it at the area where these strange things always show up hoping to catch something unusual. Not a lot of activity but there were some unusual things about it. When objects showed up they usually arrived in the same spot they always do but some objects came over there from the right-hand side of the screen. They seemed to edge forward, then back and then forward again, There was also another bright object that shows up on the right and releases five of six smaller objects who proceed to turn around and go back to the right.

      "description": "PLEASE READ THE ENTIRE REMARKS SECTION FOR HOW TO BEST WATCH THE VIDEOS AND FOR THE BEST WAY TO FIND YOUR RIDER!\n\nThe best way to figure out if you are on the course is to look at the time the video was shot. With several different groups on the course at the same time sometimes I will not have any idea if I am filming JV or Varsity.  I shot 130 GB of drone video on race day... Uploading takes a while.\n\n\"Experience the fun and thrill of sweet desert riding. The course starts on a dirt road, providing racers ¾ mile to spread the field before turning into a small wash section. Followed by a dirt road connecting into to Rampage Wash, where the real fun happens with slick rock technical sections. Rampage does offer places to “go around” several technical sections for beginners. The climb then continues up a road, providing more  passing opportunities. The downhill single track offers a perfect combination of speed sections with technical sections. While we start on the classic I-cup race descent, we do not follow it the whole way down. Instead, we cross the road about halfway down and follow a more gradually descending single track to the left. The course heads back toward the finish area on single track.\"\n\nI have about $10K worth of gear involved with doing this (more with the massive storage drives *60TB* and computers) and my son is on the PG team... I know how fun it is as a parent to see the actual course and race.  From the pit zone or the starting line you are so limited as to what you can see so... I have been trying to fly as much of the races as I can... I love doing it so... there is that but it does take time and there is some real expense involved.  \n\nMy real job where I earn my living (and the reason I can justify the equipment) is selling Real Estate in Utah County and the south end of the Salt Lake Valley. I have been doing this for 21 years and have been a broker since 1997. I am also the chair of the Pleasant Grove Planning Commission (and I am very excited about getting a new trail.)  My partner and I have sold over 2000 properties in our careers. We are very experienced. Help us out... If you or someone you know could use some help with Real Estate help us out and give us a quick call. 801-636-3739. \n\nThe drone cuts video into 4.2 gig max size chunks so while the drone can film for about 15 minutes it cuts the video taken during one flight into smaller pieces. I'll indicate that a video is the second part of a particular flight by labeling the upload with the \"a\".  So... for example the first part of the first video is 1 and the second part of the same flight would be 1a. \n\nAlso, these videos are 4K. The default for your computer is often set to show video from YouTube at 720p or less. If you look down in the corner of the video you can click on the gear symbol and crank the resolution way way up to 4k where you can actually see some amazing detail. \n\nCoaches, let me know if there is a clip you would like sent to you for a promotional video. We can figure that out...\n\nDrone's are a blast to fly and use... but here is the deal. The more people who have them and want to use them the more risk there is of an accident occurring.  At the championship I only flew my Inspire1. The white drone with the black arms. \n\nI have a Phantom 3 Professional as well as my back up. Someone else had a phantom there as well. It was zipping back and forth over the start and finish line. I hope you notice that I do NOT fly the drone over the heads of spectators and or riders (if I can help it with the riders, sometimes I may inadvertently cross a path.) I enter and exit the pit zone over areas where there are NOT crowds. And I have a marked Landing Zone set up on the edge of the pit zones for safety. I also have about 500 flights under my belt at this point. \n\nI am very very pro-drone but these must be used responsibly if we are going to be able to continue to get this type of footage. I am going to see what I can do with NICA about creating a set of NICA rules or guidelines for drone use at these races (aside from the FAA rules) that will focus on safety while giving us an opportunity to get these great shots. If you are interested in giving me some input as to what you may be concerned about please email me at Drew@utahrealestate.net. \n\nThere has to be a balance. Next year prior to flying I would hope that each of us who are interested in using our drone's at NICA events contact NICA to check to see if there are new set safety standards or rules before we fly. - Thanks... -Drew Armstrong 801-636-3739",

Various of ambulance parked in front of hospital\r\n\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\n\r\nSearch teams in Borneo have found the body of the British teenage girl, Ellie James, who went missing on Southeast Asia's tallest mountain.\r\n\r\nThe girl's body was found on Wednesday on Mount Kinabalu, barely five hundred metres (yards) from where her brother was rescued a week before.  \r\n\r\nBut bad weather, with winds gusting up to a hundred kilometres (62 miles) per hour, hindered search parties. \r\n\r\nThe weather also meant rescuers had to take several hours on Wednesday getting the body off the four thousand-one hundred and one metre (13,455-foot) mountain. \r\n\r\nConditions were too poor for helicopters to be used. \r\n\r\nEllie James was 17 and from Cornwall in the U.K. \r\n\r\nHer body was taken to a hospital in Kota Kinabalu city, about three hours drive from the mountain, where James' parents and two brothers were waiting. \r\n\r\nJames and her brother, Henry, who is 15, went missing on August 16 in bad weather as they descended with their parents and other British trekkers. \r\n\r\nThe boy was discovered six hours later at a spot where his sister had told him to wait while she went for help. \r\n\r\nDespite a search operation that totaled 70 people by Tuesday, she was not seen until rangers spotted her body, still clad in her pink jacket, during a brief spell of clear skies on Wednesday morning. \r\n\r\nShe lay 500 meters (yards) from the spot where her brother was found, said Police Chief Zul Bahrain Ismail. Rescuers had searched the area previously, but seen nothing in the persistent thick mists.\r\n\r\nA local mountain guide involved in the search told the national news agency, Bernama, that he had heard cries for help the day James was lost.\r\n\r\n\"We heard, `Help me ...help me...' and ran back and forth to try to locate the area from where the cries were coming, but our efforts were in vain because of the strong winds, the mountain echo and low visibility,\" Richard Adi was quoted as saying.\r\n\r\nZul dismissed suggestions that authorities had been slow in mounting a full-scale operation: \"We were racing against time and were badly hampered by bad weather.\"\r\n\r\nThe body was discovered face down and without visible injuries on a steep, 65-degree slope near the summit, much higher up than searchers had expected after finding footprints and other clues at a lower altitude.\r\n\r\n\r\nChong Kah Kiat, chief minister of Sabah state, where the mountain is located, expressed condolences to the parents and said they understood the difficulties of the search, The Star newspaper's online site reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bc040d6f017e7ce73e85bf6e32d2802e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Mount Kinabalu (Malay: Gunung Kinabalu) is a prominent mountain on the island of Borneo in Southeast Asia. It is located in the East Malaysian state of Sabah and is protected as Kinabalu Park, a World Heritage Site. Kinabalu is the highest peak in Borneo's Crocker Range and is the highest mountain in the Malay Archipelago as well as the highest mountain in Malaysia. Mount Kinabalu is also the 20th most prominent mountain in the world by topographic prominence.\n\nIn 1997, a re-survey using satellite technology established its summit (known as Low's Peak) height at 4,096 metres (13,438 ft) above sea level, which is some 6 metres (20 ft) less than the previously thought and hitherto published figure of 4,101 metres (13,455 ft).\n\nMount Kinabalu includes the Kinabalu montane alpine meadows ecoregion in the montane grasslands and shrublands biome. The mountain and its surroundings are among the most important biological sites in the world, with between 5,000 and 6,000 species of plants, 326 species of birds, and more than 100 mammalian species identified. Among this rich collection of wildlife are famous species such as the gigantic Rafflesia plants and the orangutan. Mount Kinabalu has been accorded UNESCO World Heritage status.\n\nLow's Peak can be climbed quite easily by a person in good physical condition and there is no need for mountaineering equipment at any point on the main route. Other peaks along the massif, however, require rock climbing skills.\n\nInfo extract from Wikipedia : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mount_Kinabalu",

      "description": "A powerful magnitude-8.3 earthquake hit off Chile's northern coast Wednesday night, causing buildings to sway in Santiago and other cities and sending people running into the streets. (Sept. 16)\n\nA powerful 8.3-magnitude earthquake struck Chile Wednesday night in the community of Illapel, 142 miles north of Santiago, leaving at least three people dead.\n\nThe temblor caused buildings to sway in Santiago and sent people looking for refuge in the streets. A tsunami of at least 13-feet high hit Chile's central coast in the hours following the quake, The Weather Channel reported. Several aftershocks hit within minutes as tsunami alarms rang in the port community of Valparaiso and authorities issued a tsunami alert for the country's coast. There were no reports of damage.\n\nThe U.S. Geological Survey reported the quake had a magnitude of 8.3. The agency also reported at least two large aftershocks with magnitudes of 6.3 and 6.4.\n\nThe quake prompted the National Weather Service to issue a tsunami watch for Hawaii.\n\nIt was so strong that it was felt in Buenos Aires and other parts of Argentina, the Buenos Aires Herald was reporting.\n\"Based on all available data a tsunami may have been generated by this earthquake that could be destructive on coastal areas even far from the epicenter,\" the warning read. \"An investigation is underway to determine if there is a tsunami threat to Hawaii.\"\n\nU.S. officials said the quake struck just offshore in the Pacific at 7:54 p.m. and was centered about 141 miles (228 kilometers) north-northwest of Santiago. It said the quake was 4.8 miles (5 kilometers) below the surface.\n\nChile's emergency office warned that big waves caused by the quake could hit the coast by 11 p.m.",

SOUNDBITE: (English) Malcolm Turnbull, Australian Minister for Environment and Water Resources:\r\n\"I'm going to just say a few words about Japan's so called scientific whaling programme which we believe it is quite clear, that around the world this scientific whaling, so called, not only demeans science because it is scientific in name only, it demeans the IWC and i'm afraid to say it does undermine the standing and reputation of Japan around the world. There are no winners from this scientific whaling programme and we are as Australia together with other like minded nations, strongly opposed to this ongoing lethal research on whales under special permit.\"\r\n4. Wide of meeting\r\n5. Cameraman\r\n6. SOUNDBITE: (English) Chris Carter, New Zealand Minister of Conservation:\r\n\"Well i'm saying to Japan on behalf of the people of New Zealand: Give up the proposal to kill 50 humpbacks. If you do that, we will regard that as a gesture of good will. We are asking you to do that to show that you are interested in dialogue, that you are interested in moving forward. For five years i've come to the IWC and i've seen very little dialogue between the conservation bloc and the small bloc of countries that continue to whale. This is a chance for Japan to show good will.\"\r\n7. Wide shot of press conference\r\n8. SOUNDBITE: (English) Joji Morishita, Director of International Negotiations, Fisheries Agency, Government of Japan:\r\n\"Our proposal this time is substantially different from previous proposals in many senses. For example we are saying that we are prepared to negotiate the number of minke whales to be allocated to our coastal communities.\"\r\n9. Cutaway of reporters\r\n10. SOUNDBITE: (English) Joji Morishita, Director of International Negotiations, Fisheries Agency, Government of Japan:\r\n\"We are prepared to establish a committee which will invite all other IWC members to actually observe the Japanese coastal whaling, so that there will be 100 percent transparency, and if something wrong happens this committee can make recommendations for change. \r\n15. Cutaway of press conference\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nA meeting of the International Whaling Commission in Anchorage, Alaska has brought out renewed calls for more protection for the marine mammals.  \r\nThe meeting convened amid heightened security for the first annual gathering held in the United States in almost two decades.\r\nScores of anti-whaling activists were in Anchorage to monitor the four-day proceedings and lobby for increased protection for the\r\nmarine mammals. \r\nThey are keeping a close watch of important issues to be addressed, including the proposed renewal of bowhead whale quota for indigenous hunters, such as Alaska natives in 10 coastal villages.\r\nThe meeting is expected to end with a 21-year moratorium on commercial whaling formally still in place despite a symbolic\r\nresolution to overturn the ban that was passed at last year's meeting. \r\nA 75 percent majority would be necessary to end the moratorium, but the vote fell short of that mark.\r\nSeveral anti-whaling members have since been added to the commission.\r\nThe moratorium was enacted in 1986 to protect several vulnerable species. \r\nPro-whaling nations, including Japan, Norway and Iceland, argue that it is no longer needed because whale populations have rebounded. \r\nNorway and Iceland do not recognise the ban and conduct commercial whaling, and Japan hunts whales under a research provision allowed by the IWC.\r\nActivists oppose a program in which Japan kills about 1,000 whales each year for scientific research and then sells the meat.\r\nThe meeting continues through Thursday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/1d01749d57c2163f41400ec6e3f91857 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

With so many varieties of fruits, vegetables and proteins, anyone with a passion for the great outdoors, who knows how to build a shelter and can gather and prepare wild eatable foods can make by without a doubt.  At least until the winter comes.  That's when the REAL challenge begins!  It's been a year since we moved to this beautiful state and we've finally began to truly adjust to our new Alaskan lifestyle.  Last year was a year of discovery and adventure but this year will be a year of living the life I've always dreamed of as an outdoors man, family man and film maker.  There will be many more discoveries to be made and more adventures than my camera batteries will be able to keep up with.  So if you've enjoyed out last year in Alaska then wait until you see what we'll do this year now that we know how to do it RIGHT! \n\nThank you GCI for the awesome internet!

      "title": "20150721: Anchorage to Whittier, The tunnel!",
      "description": "21 July 2015: This video is simply a travelogue depicting selected segments of the 1.5 hour trip from Anchorage to Whittier, AK where we were to meet a Phillips Cruises Tour aboard the M/V Klondike Express, the fastest catamaran in Alaska (said to be capable of speeds in excess of 45 mph) for the 12:30 PM \"26 Glacier\" tour of Prince William Sound.\n\nWe travelled the Seward Highway (Alaska I-1) from Anchorage to the Portage Glacier Highway where we continued passage through the \"Anton Anderson Memorial Tunnel,\" otherwise known as the \"Whittier Tunnel\" on our way to Whittier. At 2.5 miles in length through Maynard Mountain, this tunnel is the 2nd longest highway tunnel and longest combined rail and highway tunnel in North America which shares both train and automotive traffic through a single bore. Ingenious! We've recorded and included the entire trip through the tunnel! Those with claustrophobia may not want to watch this segment!\n\nWe documented our travel along these two highways which comprise some of the most beautiful scenery in America with a Cobra Dash Cam recording every inch of our journey. This resulted in over 2 hours of video total, including that of Whittier as we toured the community looking for a place to park...as well as a stop at the Alaskan Maritime Highway office to pick up our ferry boat tickets for our 3rd of August 2015 ride to Bellingham, WA.The challenge was to shorten the length of this video to something time wise under 1 hour. We managed to do so while trying to keep some of the best video along the way intact. \n\nThis video was taken beginning at 6:30 AM, which in part contributed to poor lighting along the way...resulting in sometimes not the best of video quality.\n\nThe trip begins 6:30 AM on 21 July 2015 at the JBER RV Park located near Anchorage, then continues into Anchorage where we admitted our two dogs to the \"Hound Lounge\" Kennels for the day while we travelled on to Whittier for the tour. We followed the Seward Highway to the Portage Glacier Highway located near the former village of Portage, destroyed by the 1964 earthquake. The trip continued to and through the Whittier Tunnel, an adventure in its own right...and on to Whittier. \n\nThis segment actually was originally part of an over two-hour video, which included the glacier tour as well. We decided that just getting to Whittier was worth its own dedicated segment...which is what this video is all about. If you bore easily, and don't enjoy windshield tourism...then you may want to pass on this video. On the other hand, we hope you will watch it, and enjoy the scenery as we did!\n\nPart 2 of this video effort, the 26 Glacier Tour out of Whittier, is in the works and will be uploaded soon!\n\nInteresting related websites:\n\nCompanion Video: 26 Glacier Cruise\nhttp://youtu.be/_kKm85nnslw\n\nhttp://www.dot.state.ak.us/creg/whittiertunnel/history.shtml\n\nhttp://www.alaska.org/detail/whittier-tunnel\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_Glacier_Highway\n\nhttp://www.alaska.org/guide/seward-highway\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seward_Highway\n\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portage_Glacier_Highway",

      "title": "WORK STRESS HAPPENS - [Living In Alaska 214]",
      "description": "I typically spend 5 to 6 hours editing each day when most vloggers only spend 2 - 3.  Most of my time is spent color correcting, adjusting audio and adding special effects because I'm a bit of a perfectionist but most other vlogger don't go that far with quality.  They focus more on content which is very understandable.  While I do enjoy being a perfectionist, it is beginning to wear me down a bit because it's not giving me enough time to get out and live like I want to for myself and these vlogs.  Keep in mind that the time spent on editing doesn't include the time spent on uploading, sharing, replying to comments, emails and other business related stuff.  So when some people say \"5 - 6 hours of editing is hardly work\", they need to remember that I don't really get time off because even when I'm not editing, promoting or connecting with viewers, I'm still having to think about vlogging in every given moment that I'm \"free\".  My mind never gets a break.  Plus, as someone who is a die hard creative, it's hard not to overthink every situation.  To be a daily vlogger, I just need to live my life and share it how it is but as a creative, I always want to tell stories and experiment with new things but I can't seem to find the line between being a vlogger and story teller.  What that said, my vlogs aren't fake in any way.  I just find myself editing my real life events as if they're daily short films when they're not.  So I'm going to keep things simple for the next month and stick to being a \"normal\" vlogger until things with SMPFilms are worked out.  Things are tough for me right now because of that situation but soon it may be over.\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/DudeLikeHELLA\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/smpfilms\nhttp://www.twitter.com/kristenspov\n\nKRISTEN'S INSTAGRAM:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/kristenspov\n\nOUR OTHER YOUTUBE CHANNELS:\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/smpfilms\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/TheMeanKitty\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/MrSafety\n\nSEND US MAIL:\nCory and Kristen\nPO Box 771351\nEagle River, AK 99577\nUnited States\n\nPLAYSTATION 4 GAMER TAGS:\nCory - DudeLikeHELLA\nKristen - MrsSafety\n\nThank you GCI for the awesome internet!

      "description": "In case you haven't seen our last video (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbwokYTj7sI), Kristen and I are having a baby!  We're currently about 7 weeks pregnant but we've only known for 2 weeks.  We just couldn't say anything to anyone until we told our parents but now that we've done that, we can finally share this amazing experience.  Most people say to wait at least 3 months to break the news because 80% of the problems that happen during a pregnancy, happen during that time.  However, we're confident that everything will go just fine.  If something does happen, then that's life and we'll deal with it but again, we're feeling pretty good about this.  So far this has been the most amazing experience and I've never been so happy and excited.  Kristen will be the best mother a child can have and I will undoubtedly be the best father that I can possibly be.  The baby isn't here yet and I already love it with everything I am.  Life is good!  \n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/DudeLikeHELLA\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/smpfilms\nhttp://www.twitter.com/kristenspov\n\nKRISTEN'S INSTAGRAM:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/kristenspov\n\nOUR OTHER YOUTUBE CHANNELS:\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/smpfilms\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/TheMeanKitty\nhttp://www.YouTube.com/MrSafety\n\nSEND US MAIL:\nCory and Kristen\nPO Box 771351\nEagle River, AK 99577\nUnited States\n\nPLAYSTATION 4 GAMER TAGS:\nCory - DudeLikeHELLA\nKristen - MrsSafety\n\nThank you GCI for the INSANE internet!

      "description": "Now I know why not to fly my HELLA-copter in sub-zero temperatures.  Lesson learned!\n\nHere's my recipe for \"HELLAbut For Days!\":\nFirst, make the sauce in a medium sized bowl\n- 2/3 cups of Thai sweet chili sauce\n- 3 Tbsp. fish sauce\n- 1/2 cup of soy sauce\n- about a 1/4 cup of ground coriander\n- about 1/4 tsp. black pepper\n- about a tablespoon of garlic powder\n- 3 tablespoons of lemon juice\n- 2 tablespoons of brown sugar\nBe sure to mix all of that together well because the brown sugar will settle at the bottom otherwise.\nWhen ready, lay your halibut fillets in a dish or bowl that just fits the fish and carefully pour the sauce over the fish until it's covers the fish 2/3 of the way.  Be sure to flip the fish to make sure it's covered completely.  Stick it in the fridge to marinate for about 10 minutes to 24 hours (doesn't matter too much as long as it's not in there TOO long).\nWhen ready, remove the fish from the dish and lay them out evenly on a baking pan.  Once placed, pour half of the sauce left in the dish onto the halibut.  Stick them in the oven at 400ºF for 10 minutes, pour the rest of the sauce over the fish and continue to cook until the fish is white and flaky on the inside.  Serve with brown rice and broccoli for a nice compliment of flavors and enjoy!   Chances are you'll have a lot of sauce left over, so cook up more fish another night or share the sauce with a friend!\n\nLIKE US ON FACEBOOK:\nhttp://www.facebook.com/DudeLikeHELLA\n\nFOLLOW US ON TWITTER:\nhttp://www.twitter.com/smpfilms\nhttp://www.twitter.com/kristenspov\n\nKRISTEN'S INSTAGRAM:\nhttp://www.instagram.com/kristenspov\n\nOUR OTHER YOUTUBE CHANNELS:\nShort Films - http://www.YouTube.com/smpfilms\nCat Related - http://www.YouTube.com/TheMeanKitty\nRandom Music - http://www.YouTube.com/MrSafety\n\nFor business inquiries, email me:\nmrsafety@smpfilms.com\n\nSEND US MAIL:\nCory and Kristen\nPO Box 771351\nEagle River, AK 99577\nUnited States\n\nPLAYSTATION 4 GAMER TAGS:\nCory - DudeLikeHELLA\nKristen - MrsSafety\n\nThank you GCI for the INSANE internet!

      "description": "Using a Silver Reed model 328 knitting machine, I begin to knit a Season 12 Dr Who scarf. To accomplish the garter stitch, I utilize a garter bar, an accessory for the machine that allows you to remove, flip and add the project back to the machine to turn stockinette to garter.\n\nFor this scarf, I am using the acrylic DK recommendations from http://www.doctorwhoscarf.com\n\nKnitPicks Brava Sport:\nFor Red, Paprika\nFor Tan, Almond\nFor Brown, Brindle\nFor Purple, Currant\nStylecraft Double Knit Special:\nFor Gold, Gold\nFor Grey, Graphite\nHayfield Bonus DK Extra Value:\nFor Green, Moss Green\n\nWatching the tutorial by Alex Murphy on his Doctored Knits site at https://doctoredknits.wordpress.com/ I was able to approximate the color joins.\n\nThanks to Richard Gamble, my good friend who turned me on to this project after I acquired the knitting machines and who tracked down and ordered the scarf while I went through skeins of waste yarn trying to perfect the procedures I discuss in this video.\n\nI apologize for the light in the background at the beginning of the vlog. I did not notice how bright it was until I went to edit the video later on.",

All the guests, which included three youths who have done ghost tours in the past with mom, experienced a major supernatural event, and there was no short supply of chicken skin! A locked gate mysteriously opened right in front of everyone, multiple anomalies captured on film around the same time, and lots of activity on the dowsing rods and Mel Meter in response to our questions. Needless to say, everyone had a really good time!\n\nThe guests each had a cool research instrument courtesy of Kahuna Research Group, and were well prepared to deal with such an event. Our guides are certified paranormal investigators specifically trained to understand the supernatural, who not only \"know\" the stories and legends, they have actually investigated them and are currently involved in active paranormal cases.\n\nEach tour is like an investigation / historical tour in one...which makes it more exciting than any other ghost tour in Hawaii.",

The crew dropped smoke flares to help the Lomalo crew locate the fishermen and dropped water to the survivors.\n\nThe survivors spent more than 10 hours in the water, according to the Coast Guard, before the Lomalo brought them to another vessel to bring them to their next port of call in several days.\n\nNo injuries were reported.",

      "description": "Aloha all, \nThis is a ''call to action'' to ignite the Prime Directive that is inside all of us. In-fact it is in all species that are with us sharing the planet. Everything wants to ''Evolve''\n\n''Evolution'' of the personal self ( mind and body) and  to help all other collective ''sentient'' species is one of the most authentic and deeper layered parts of our evolutionary selves.  \n\nWe all as a species can ''Evolve'' in our own special ways if we want to and see that is part of our larger purpose. All we need is some of the tools and guidance to start our journey. \n\nWe are the builders of form so we have the intelligence to rebuild ourselves and the planet that have really desecrated. \n\nThe ''Earth'' or mother ''Gaia'' is our church/Temple that we all share and live off of and live on.  \n\nOnce we upgrade, enhance and optimize ourselves in many of the departments that we call ''Terrain Modification''  First of all in order for us to ''Evolve ourselves that means we really have to start loving ourselves more. \n\n We will feel the magnificence of the ''Nature Spirits'' and a form of equanimity with ourselves when we really connect back to Nature and start taking care and honoring the planet we all live on. Helping others make the more reasonable and logical lifestyle changes will help tremendously in getting more peple involved with the ''Prime Directive'' \n\nIntegrity with yourself  is a huge part of Prime Directive. Even if you do not want to change your diet you can still start some of the profound protocols that will massively change your detoxification and parasite loads that are in everyone. Remember there are 100 million diabetics and obese peple in the USA alone. Body-fat is a sickness and it can be cured. \nWe as a species have become a parasite to the planet, to Nature and to all living things that thought is not really easy to look at. \n\nOnce we clean up our food supply to ''REAL FOOD'' and super charge our mind and body with ''CONDUCTIVE MINERALS'' then we start to really become illuminated or some will say start to awaken to not want to be part of the insanity any-longer. \n\nTo really learn the variety of techniques that you can do is to practice these techniques and then practice and learn from our private school www.EartherAcademy.com where we have over 250 private videos on many beginning-intermediate and advanced techniques, protocols, disciplines ideas, concepts etc to take your experience to the next level of detoxification and rejuvenation. \n\n Learn the ''Terrain Modification Principles'' is a must to live healthier in this world that is so dysfunctional and toxic.  \n\n Everything in Life is all a ''Work in Progress''. \n\n''Evolution'' is the Game at hand!  :)) \n\n  You are what you ''eat, drink, say, hear and do'' so be conscious of that.\n\n En-joy the Journey !    :)) Dr r \n\nPS: The semi-private 21 day Terrain Modification Medically Supervised Retreats are open now on and off all year long.

      "description": "A nearly 70-foot-long (21-metre) dock that floated ashore on an Oregon beach was torn loose from a fishing port in northern Japan by last year's tsunami and drifted across thousands of miles of Pacific Ocean, a Japanese Consulate official said Wednesday.\r\nA commemorative plaque on the dock showed it was one of four owned by Aomori Prefecture at the port of Misawa on the northern tip of Japan.\r\nOne of the four docks turned up several weeks later on an island south of Misawa, but the other two are still missing, said Akihisa Sato, an engineer with Zeniya Kaiyo Service, the dock's Tokyo-based manufacturer. \r\nThe docks weigh 165 tons each, Sato said. \r\nThe one that floated to Oregon was first spotted floating offshore Monday, and mistaken by several people for a barge, said Chris Havel, spokesman for the Oregon Department of Parks and Recreation. \r\nHavel said it was \"the first real verifiable evidence in Oregon of debris of this type.\" \r\nIt washed ashore early Tuesday on Agate Beach, a mile north of Newport on the central Oregon Coast. \r\nIt's made of concrete with a metal pontoon and measures 66 feet (20 metres) long, 19 feet (5.8 metres) wide and 7 feet (2.1 metres) high. \r\nThe distance between Japan and Oregon is roughly 5,000 miles. (8,046 kilometres)\r\nA radiation check of the dock came up negative, which was to be expected if the dock broke loose before the nuclear power plant accident triggered by the waves. \r\nThe parks department was overseeing efforts to identify and remove the dock. \r\nState police were posted to keep people from climbing on the dock, said Mitch Vance, shellfish programme manager for the Oregon Department of Fish and Wildlife.\r\nBeach-goer Marjie Cannon described the event as \"a piece of history, right here in front of us.\"\r\nThe Japanese coastal town of Misawa, where the dock originated, sustained extensive tsunami damage but is north of the most heavily hit areas in Iwate and Miyagi prefectures. \r\nThe four docks that swept away from Misawa were installed four years ago, Sato said. \r\nThey were used to transfer fish from fishing boats to trucks waiting to transport them to market.\r\nSato said the March 2011 tsunami also destroyed many buildings and structures around the port.\r\nThe bulk of the debris from the tsunami is not expected until winter, but fast-moving examples have been arriving on North America's shores. \r\nThey include a soccer ball that washed up in Alaska and a shipping container holding a Harley-Davidson motorcycle with Japanese license plates that turned up in British Columbia earlier this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7ea9213ad7fb72c3df380a4deb36e10b \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

God bless you and your family!\nWe would love to hear your comments and please like and share this video. \n\nAs we continue our study in Genesis we find Joseph’s life taking a dramatic turn. It seemed that everything that could go wrong did go wrong. After receiving a dream from God that he would rise above his brothers, his brothers didn’t think much of Joseph’s dream and plotted to kill him. This was changed into an opportunity to make some money and he was sold as a slave instead. \n Being purchased by Potiphar, captain of the bodyguard, he found great success in Potiphar’s house. But Potiphar’s wife tried to trap him into a liaison, but he refused. As a result he was thrown into prison, his dreams seeming impossibly distant. \n Here again he found success and was trusted to oversee other prisoners. He was asked to oversee the chief cupbearer and chief baker who then each had dreams. Joseph was given the interpretation that the cupbearer would be restored, so Joseph asked that he remember to help him get out of prison. But he did not remember for two more years.\n But then Pharaoh had a dream that no one could interpret, and the cupbearer remembered Joseph. When he appeared before Pharaoh he once again pointed toward God as the One to glorify and gave the interpretation – there would be seven years of prosperity followed by seven years of famine. He then suggested ways to prepare for the famine by storing up grain during the seven years of plenty. Pharaoh saw the wisdom of Joseph, set him in a place of authority that he might prepare for the nation for the years of famine. \n He also gave Joseph an Egyptian wife and she bore him two sons. It is in the naming of these two sons that we focus our study this morning, because as he reveals his heart in the naming of these boys we gain insight into our own lives as well. \n\nPastor Rich Jones\nRich Jones Sermons  \nRich Jones Calvary Chapel\nCalvary Chapel Worship Center\nCalvary Chapel Hillsboro\nCalvary Chapel Beaverton \n\n\nTags:\nPastor Rich Jones\nRich Jones\nRich Jones\nRich Jones Sermons 2015\nRich Jones Sermons 2014 \n\nRich Jones Church, Rich Jones Christian,  Rich Jones Christian Church, Rich Jones Bible Study, Rich Jones Prayer, Pastor Rich Jones Faith, Rich Jones Grace, Rich Jones Healing, Rich Jones Teaching, Rich Jones Bible Teacher, Rich Jones Bible Verse, Rich Jones Healing, Rich Jones Teaching, Rich Jones Transformation, Rich Jones Faith, Rich Jones Salvation, Rich Jones Truth, Rich Jones  Prayer, Rich Jones Bible, Rich Jones, Rich Jones Sermons 2014, Rich Jones 2014 Full Sermons, Rich Jones Full Sermons, Rich Jones Sermons, Rich Jones 2015, Rich Jones Sermons 2015, Pastor Rich Jones 2015 Full Sermons, pastor Rich Jones Full Sermons, Rich Jones 2015, Rich Jones Calvary Chapel, Calvary Chapel Worship Center, Calvary Chapel Hillsboro, Calvary Chapel Beaverton",

So I had to try one myself.\nMy lampshade is Atlas or Titan Cedar which is more dense than the more common western red cedar. It is about 7 1/2 inches in diameter and 8 inches high. I'm leaving it not sanded and without any finish.\nWith the depth inside the lampshade, this was tough going. I feared that at any moment a catch would destroy my work.\nYet both the lampshade and I survived the experience.\nIt was challenging.\nGood turning.\nEnter your email at http://www.AsWoodTurns.com & I'll let you know when the next easy woodturning project video is ready.\nBlog: http://www.AsWoodTurns.com\nFB: http://www.Facebook.com/AsWoodTurns",

      "description": "Over the weekend of September 12-13th's new moon and partial solar eclipse in Virgo, Virgos Wyndra (born September 18, 1984) and Ruji (born September 18, 1985) manifested themselves a pre-birthday astrological event called Saturn's Rapture (http://bit.ly/SaturnsRapture) at their favorite fifth-dimensional travel destination, Lesbian Lake. Saturn's Rapture celebrated not only the tumult and rapture of the Saturn return—and the dizzying torque of orbiting into one's thirties after 2+ years of being spun out on Saturn's rings—but also the apocalyptic Blood Moon Tetrad Prophecy, the New Earth Ascension to 5D, the asteroid, the earthquake, the black hole portals of CERN, and all the other theories positing that the global shift to higher frequencies will hit some sort of crescendo on or near September 28, 2015.\n---\nThis raw footage shows Wyndra entering her long-distance lover's GPS coordinates into the dial pad of the Spacetimeship (interdimensional Ascension vehicle/poor man's Merkabah) so as to telepathically beam her over to the party. The Spacetimeship is shown parked at the 3rd Eye Herb Bar (http://bit.ly/3rdEyeHerbBar), an accommodation generously provided by Metatron for guests needing entheogenic Ascension assistance prior to upgrading their DNA in the pineal activation portal. Music-reactive LEDs cycle to resonances of Metatron (channeled via YouTube: http://j.mp/15minMetatron) in the background for brainwave entrainment.\n---\nSo anyway, YOLO!!!! Rapture's nigh!!!\n---\nMore info in blog post: http://bit.ly/SaturnsRapture",

This shouldn't be surprising as these underground Reservoirs seem to be having some serious problems with them. \n\nThe reason this is now going to cost $170 Million and take longer is because the ground is going to have to be stabilized and there is an earthquake concern that needs to be addressed so all of this is going to cost money and take time to complete. \n\n http://jgpolitics.com/2015/09/portland-to-spend-on-washingtonpark",

Efficient. Affordable. Friendly. Our garbage disposal went out and Dan from Einstein came out to fix it. He showed up on time and was great about going over the various product options available to us. He wasn't aggressive about selling us on the most expensive route to take. He gave us our options and was very thorough to explain the differences in price, quality and effectiveness. He was very friendly (and patient with our puppy) and was in and out within about an hour. From scheduling to install and billing - these guys are the best!”\n\nEinstein Plumbing and Heating\n3475 N Hwy 97, Building B\nBend, OR 97701\n(541) 420-8888\n\nCheck out more Reviews on YouTube from Einstein Plumbing and Heating\n===============\nplumbers bend or\nhttps://youtu.be/L7BNnH0Em9s \n\nplumbers bend oregon\nhttps://youtu.be/L7BNnH0Em9s\nhttps://youtu.be/h5I8h1aRq4o\n\nbend oregon plumbers\nhttps://youtu.be/JJHvSq_w4A8\n\nCentral oregon heating and cooling\nhttps://youtu.be/MHmAyxw5TAg\n\nBend Plumbers \nhttps://youtu.be/GQ_J_gONK4E\n\nBend Plumber \nhttps://youtu.be/XQzRRo5i0Zk\n\nPlumbers in Bend Oregon \nhttps://youtu.be/t33q1jpYDeY\n\nPlumbing Services\n=================\nLeaks\nWater Heaters\nToilets\nFaucets\nShowers & Tubs\nClogged Drains\nFrozen Pipes\nSewer Lines\nGrease Traps\nSewer Jetting\nRecirculation Pumps\nGas Lines\nEarthquake Valves\nKitchen Remodeling\nBathroom Remodeling\nLeak Detection\nFixtures & Appliances\nOutdoor Showers\nOutdoor Kitchens\nAnd Much Much More!\n\nCheck out more reviews for Einstein Plumbing and Heating\n===============\nYelp \nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz/einstein-plumbing-and-heating-bend\n\nGoogle+ \nhttps://plus.google.com/105543197238884435958/about\n\nFacebook \nhttps://www.facebook.com/Einstein.Plumbing.Bend.Oregon/reviews\n\nhttp://www.einsteinplumbingandheating.com/plumbing-bend-oregon/\n#bendplumbers\n#plumbersbendor\n#plumbingbendoregon",

I mean it''s a terrible, terrible thing,\" said Downer as he toured Chinatown.\r\nThe violence was sparked by rumours that China or Taiwan had paid lawmakers to support the election of the Pacific nation''s unpopular new prime minister, Snyder Rini.\r\nThe upheaval in the South Pacific nation forced ethnic Chinese to flee their homes and seek shelter under police protection.\r\nAustralia, New Zealand and Fiji have boosted police and troop numbers in the archipelago to more than 1,050 over recent days as police investigate who instigated the rioting.\r\nOvernight on Friday, only one arrest and a sole bottle-throwing incident disturbed the fragile calm since the riots.\r\nIn talks with Rini, Downer was expected to emphasise the need for the government to fight corruption and strengthen its ability to enforce law and order.\r\nOpposition parties plan a no-confidence motion against Rini on Wednesday, which he has said he expects to win.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/37d19eae17a64c8e958de490e1ffbca9 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "CWC took to the streets over the weekend with a mini Crop Over type motorcade as the company continued to “Paint Barbados Blue” launching its refreshed consumer brand, Flow. The motorcade was part of a series of events that were held across the island from July 16-19 to celebrate of the new Flow.  \nStarting from St. Lucy in the north and St. Philip in the east, the brightly decorated convoy, which included Flow Brand Ambassador Anderson ‘Blood’ Armstrong, traversed the island, stopping in communities with give-aways and chances to win while introducing Barbadians to the new Flow, its products and services. \nManaging Director of Cable and Wireless Barbados, Niall Sheehy noted the brand had been officially launched on Thursday to employees and key stakeholders and on Friday and Saturday to customers in Flow retail stores and throughout communities island-wide. \n\n“Following exciting launch events earlier in the week, the ‘FLOWing’ motorcade is a fitting way to introduce the new Flow to the people of Barbados, so that they can get an up-close and personal look at the new brand. It is also a great way for our employees to meet our customers face-to-face, and for them to interact with us and share their perspectives,” he said.\n\nSheehy added, “We are proud to be able to offer to our customers, and potential customers, new and exciting quad play opportunities as we commit to putting our customers at the forefront of our business. We want to completely transform the customer experience and provide best-in-class service.”\n\nDirector of Marketing, Shelly-Ann Hee Chung, said that through the fun and entertainment provided by the ‘FLOWing’ motorcade, the company was able to bring Barbadians up to date on current developments and future plans surrounding the new Flow.\n“The response from the public has been overwhelming and it was great to hit the streets with the Flow team. We are very excited about what the future holds,” she said. “Of course, we realize that our success will not only be dependent upon the technology available to us, but the way in which we deliver that technology to our customers.” \nAfter parading through the streets of Barbados, the motorcade culminated with a mini concert in Independence Square featuring Flow Brand Ambassadors, Lil Rick, Peter Ram, Kirk Brown, Blood and Shanta Prince, as well as a mini exposition, which showcased the new brand’s products and services. \n\nAs part of its commitment to customer service, the new Flow honoured its very first residential customer since the new brand launch at the concert event. Carol Bradshaw took Flow’s TV Essential Watch services and bundled it with the Superfast Bundled Plus Broadband service. As a thank you, Carol was awarded three months of free service from Flow. Kyle Smith was also a winner as and received a 40 inch Samsung TV as he was the first customer to sign up for quad-play services – TV, Internet, Voice and Mobile.\n\nThe motorcade was part of the official introduction of Flow to the public in the first of several market launches set to take place across the Caribbean. Flow will now be the consumer brand operating in some 15 markets across the region including Cayman Islands, Trinidad and Tobago, Barbados and Jamaica among others.\n\nWith the integration of Columbus International Inc and Cable & Wireless, Flow is now poised to deliver quad play services - mobile, broadband, fixed voice and TV/video to its customers.",

She is listed in a stable condition in hospital. \r\nAnother woman broke her leg while trying to rush out of her home, according to a police report.\r\nAP Television footage showed large cracks in the ground in the aftermath of the magnitude 7.4 quake.\r\nIt was centred 14 miles (23 kilometres) northwest of Martinique's coastline and lasted longer than 20 seconds.\r\nIt apparently took the worst toll on this French island, collapsing the roofs of a bank and a store in the capital, Fort-de-France, and leaving cracks in several other buildings.\r\nTwo people in Martinique were injured when they panicked and jumped through windows, government official Lorne Martin told Radio Martinique. \r\nOthers were slightly injured when they tried to flee their homes, and dozens were receiving treatment for panic attacks, she said. \r\nOther islands in the Lesser Antilles including St. Lucia and St. Vincent reported cracks in homes and waterlines.\r\nThe quake struck at 1400 EST (1900 GMT) and was felt hundreds of miles (kilometres) away in Puerto Rico to the west, and Venezuela and Suriname to the south.\r\nExperts said the depth of the quake, at 90 miles (145 kilometres), spared the region from severe destruction.\r\nThe Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii said the quake was too deep to generate a destructive tsunami.\r\nGovernment officials announced schools would be closed on Friday and that some roads on the northern end of the island have been blocked because of cracks.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/496b461d45e578bd7add3ba5b2c93a20 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

In her opening statement she communicated the main purpose of the Open House was to debunk untruths being posted on the blog (BU) and Facebook.\n\nA very informed crowd despite not having access to an open mike peppered the panel with questions about the project delivered by an obnoxious moderator. The bottom line: those who attended left unhappy because key questions were not answered or were deflected.\n\nThe disappointment for BU was hearing responses to two questions. The first was if Cahill Energy is aware of a plasma gasification plant built on any island of similar size to Barbados anywhere in the world. Clare Cowan answered she was not aware. And the second question: how would environmental standards be enforced – to which Clare Cowan responded a community effort is her best recommendation. She added the government will likely enact legislation borrowed from the UK or Canada to enforce the standards required.\n\nRead the the rest of it HERE https://goo.gl/HdrNIJ",

      "description": "Thousands of pilgrims flocked to a barren mountainside in central Haiti for a two-day religious gathering over the weekend.\r\nOrganised by Our Lady of Fatima Bible Centre, the event in the town of Bois-Neuf drew clergy and parishioners alike, in order to encourage conversion to Catholicism or a renewal of faith.\r\nThe priests marched up the mountain on Sunday, blessing pilgrims with holy water, and were followed by a procession of women who danced behind them carrying baskets of fruit and vegetables on their heads as an offering.\r\nPilgrims listened intently, many holding rosary beads, as priest Jules Campion called on people to convert to Catholicism.\r\nCampion used the devastating earthquake that hit Haiti in 2010 to call on people to convert.\r\n\"If we don't convert, we will have another 12 January 2010 - but worse. If we don't convert Port-au-Prince won't be destroyed - it will disappear completely. You must convert,\" he implored the crowd.\r\nThe earthquake killed tens of thousands of people and displaced 1.5 (m) million others.\r\nThe pilgrims sang and danced and also took part in group prayers.\r\n\"Prayer is really important, it helps you to recharge mentally and spiritually with god,\" said pilgrim Micheal Cherilus.\r\nSome of the pilgrims also carried their passports with them in hopes that they may secure a visa to a country with more opportunities than what deeply impoverished Haiti has to offer.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/235dc95cee57b79e58a8c2e49038ecdd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

It's happening. Is a large celestial object orbiting closer to Earth every year? Is this the year? Every summer the earth goes through some serious changes. Some great Nibiru perspective in this one at 22:12. The volcano shot has some incredible sounds if you listen, and hopefully the volcano exploding lava is something you ONLY see on video. Cheers to that.\nI made this video to try to place the viewer in a perspective of 'being on the other end of the camera,' to think outside the box, and realize the likes as to what has been starting to occur more, and more, 'every summer.' Prepare in whatever way you can - for if the water shuts down, the city decides to flush the pipes, an earthquake, or worse (God forbid).\nRealize what is happening and starting the happen around you. It's a part of life, but one that should not be ignored. DO what you will. Thanks for watching.\nEvery summer the planet earth experiences some very serious 'torque.' Feel free to share this video, I just put it here for reasons of my own. A pattern that I have noticed over the years? Every June to September holds some 'very odd' sudden surprises or 'reactions' of our very planet.\nThe video ends containing information that you may think unnecessary but think again.. it's all relevant.\nYou decide... but something is amiss and in ways like never before. Is this the 'big' event?\nPrepare? For what? Anything. Flood, earthquake, tornado, etc.\nJust in case. Better to be prepared with a plan than 'not at all,' don't you think? .",

One rather wild notion current in the\r\narea at the moment is that the whole Californian\r\nseaboard could just slide away into the Pacific.  The\r\nscientists are a good deal less pessimistic than that,\r\nbut there does seem to be cause for concern.

      "description": "This video report will show the ritual 911 code contained in the recent Shepard Smith, FOX TV media report, regarding a coming major earthquake, that will create a tsunami and impact the North West Coast of California and more.\n\nAt present I still do not want to discuss or speak to anyone, so for those that need someone to explain what is there to see in this ritual code observation,, you will have to catch me at a better time, for I am at present in no quick hurry to talk or willing to explain anything to anyone.\n\nStop the video to ponder the charts if they move too fast and I would tell you that the only reason I did this video, was to affirm for others that this event was in fact a coded 911 future event, that needs to be seen and discussed among yourselves.\n\nThis Shepard - FOX report clearly suggests that 7-23, 7-24 and 7-25 are going to be used in some false flag event.  I reveal this observation, only to re-burden the NWO with their event karma, that is no longer secret or hidden.\n\nThe code is present for all to see and I would hope that you ponder the code and numbers at your leisure.  I am just at present not willing to engage in any discussion, because of my current state of mind.\n\nI am trying to get back on my feet, but it is much harder than I could have imagined.  Thank you all for your patience and understanding.\n\nHeads up.  911 events have been planned and I hope to have exposed their plans based on the disclosure of their coded material fused into the FOX report.\n\nBackground Sources and Links:\nhttp://video.foxnews.com/v/4356513070001/report-mega-quake-could-kill-13000-in-pacific-northwest/?#sp=show-clips\n\nFAIR USE NOTICE: This video contains copyrighted material.

      "description": "Japan Tsunami 2011 - Tohoku Earthquake Shocking Video\n\nAn erupting volcanic island that is expanding off Japan could trigger a tsunami if its freshly-formed lava slopes collapse into the sea, scientists say.\n\nThe small, but growing, island appeared last year and quickly engulfed the already-existing island of Nishinoshima, around 1000 kilometres south of Tokyo.\n\nIt now covers 1.26 square kilometres.\n\nThe island's craters are currently spewing out 200,000 cubic metres of lava every day - enough to fill 80 Olympic swimming pools - which is accumulating in its east, scientists said.\n\n\"If lava continues to mount on the eastern area, part of the island's slopes could collapse and cause a tsunami,\" warned Fukashi Maeno, assistant professor of the Earthquake Research Institute at the University of Tokyo.\n\nHe said a rockfall of 12 million cubic metres of lava would generate a one metre tsunami that could travel faster than a bullet train, hitting the island of Chichijima - 130kms away - in around 18 minutes, he said.\n\nChichijima, home to about 2000 people, is the largest island in the Ogasawara archipelago, a wild and remote chain that is administratively part of Tokyo.\n\n\"The ideal way to monitor and avoid a natural disaster is to set up a new tsunami and earthquake detection system near the island, but it's impossible for anyone to land on the island in the current situation,\" Maeno added.\n\nAn official from the Japan Meteorological Agency, which monitors earthquakes and tsunamis, said the agency is watching for any signs of anything untoward.\n\n\"We studied the simulation this morning, and we are thinking of consulting with earthquake prediction experts ... about the probability of this actually happening, and what kind of measures we would be able to take,\" he said.\n\nJapan's northeast was ravaged by a huge tsunami in March 2011, when a massive undersea earthquake sent a wall of water barrelling into the northeast coast, killing more than 18,000 people and wrecking whole towns.\n\nLink Video http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmGm8PlHnXs",

      "description": "A large earthquake rolled through California's northern Bay Area early on Sunday, damaging some buildings, igniting fires, knocking out power to tens of thousands and sending residents running out of their homes in the darkness.\r\nThe 6.0-magnitude quake caused six significant fires, including at four mobile homes, according to a Napa Division Fire official.\r\nThe epicentre of the earthquake that struck Northern California, the strongest in the area in 25 years, was just six miles southwest of Napa, California, the centre of California's winemaking region.\r\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) described the tremor as the largest earthquake to shake the Bay Area since the 6.9-magnitude Loma Prieta quake in 1989.\r\nSeveral other smaller fires were reported and firefighting efforts were complicated by broken water mains.\r\nLocal residents counted the cost of the damage on Sunday.\r\n\"All my valuable stuff is in the bedroom so most of everything is gone,\" said 83-year-old Nola Rawlins whose mobile home was destroyed by fire.\r\nWinemakers in California's storied Napa Valley woke up to thousands of broken bottles and barrels as a result of Sunday's earthquake.\r\nThe earthquake couldn't have come at a worse time for the region, which has just started harvesting the 2014 crop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/c4741cd63ab6e99c0760fc342ff541fb \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The deer in this video are a prime example of hidden dangers amidst the natural beauty of this area of the San Andreas Fault.  Anytime you can see deer in this area, you can be certain that mountain lions are also in the immediate vicinity.  This is mountain lion territory and deer are the main source of food for mountain lions. Hikers are warned never to walk alone on The Sawyer Camp Trail, as well as on all San Mateo County Park Trails.",

      "description": "See more at http://ybca.org/work-progress\n\nEmerging from a desire to create a dynamic, nontraditional experiment in our galleries, Work in Progress: Investigations South of Market forefronts the process of art making and opens up a conversation about site, both within and beyond YBCA’s doors. Responding to a prompt from YBCA, six artists take a unique point of departure from which to explore the SOMA neighborhood. Inspirations include the events that have shaped the neighborhood including the 1906 earthquake and fire, which physically and psychologically transformed the landscape of San Francisco, the more recent changes that have come about since the opening of AT&T Park in 2000, and the environmental impacts of the building boom. Other projects look at the people who have inhabited the neighborhood over the years, from the Ohlone to the wealthy landowners of the 19th century to those who work and live here today.\n\nWork in Progress is an examination of place, artistic practice, and space. For the project, we invited a group of artists to submit proposals that address San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood through research-based inquiry. The selected participants—Terry Berlier, Val Britton, Tom Loughlin, Jenny Odell, Stadium Projects (Joshua Peder Stulen, Monte Masi, and Lex Kosieradzki), and Weston Teruya—have been grouped into three sequential residencies, and the galleries are effectively becoming a working studio for them during their time at YBCA. As each residency rotates out, the works produced remain on site, with each residency building on the last and presenting a new layer of the cumulative experience.\n\nYBCA’s neighborhood has long been a locus of change, contention, and renewal. The newly commissioned works for this exhibition aim to deepen our understanding of, and connect back to, this rich history and legacy. Even as the artists investigate a specific locale within San Francisco, they also look beyond it, exploring broader themes of generosity, urban planning, environmental impact, and historical change.",

SOUNDBITE (English): John Philipe Avouac, seismologist, CalTech\r\n\"This earthquake occurred along the ++indistinct++ plate boundary which is the most active, the most rapidly deforming plate boundary on earth today, which separates the Pacific plate from the Australian plate. It''s a subduction zone. The rate of slip along that subduction zone is about 24 centimetres per year. For comparison, the rate on the St Andreas fault is in the order of 3.5 centimetres per year, so it''s nearly one order of magnitude larger.\"\r\n10. Wide of map where earthquake struck\r\n11. Close up of map showing epicenter\r\n12. Close up of map\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nA massive magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked the South Pacific island nation of Tonga on Thursday, triggering international warnings of a potentially lethal tsunami - but those messages failed to reach the tiny nation.\r\nThe warning raised jitters from Hawaii to New Zealand, until authorities called it off two hours later because the quake never generated any massive waves. \r\nHowever, the tsunami warnings did not reach Tonga, raising troubling questions about the effectiveness of such alerts, which have come under global scrutiny since an earthquake-driven tsunami in the Indian Ocean nearly 18 months ago left at least 216,000 people dead or missing in a dozen countries.\r\nThe 4:26 a.m. (17:26GMT) earthquake, about 150 kilometres (95 miles) south of the Tongan island of Neiafu, did little damage to South Pacific countries beyond breaking windows.\r\nIn California, scientists at the Seismology Lab at the California Institute of Technology studied the particulars of the earthquake on a seismograph, a device that detects and records the vibrations of an earthquake.\r\nSeismologist John Philipe Avouac explained that the motion between the Pacific and Australian plates caused the earthquake.\r\nKeyword-earthquake\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f339448a39ff37e50dea16d5dd51a7e0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Solutions to humanitarian disasters: International Medical Corps by Nancy Aossey\n\nTuesday, March 11, 2014\nUSC Global Health Lecture Series 2013-2014\nUniversity of Southern California\nWorking on the frontlines of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, International Medical Corps President and CEO Nancy Aossey and her colleagues were in Rwanda as the genocide unfolded, treating patients amid unimaginable brutality; in Somalia at the height of the civil war and famine, training local health workers amid the chaos; and in the Balkans during the ethnic cleansing, establishing emergency medicine and ambulance infrastructure. In recent years, International Medical Corps has been a first-responder to the Indian Ocean tsunami, Haiti earthquake and Japan earthquake and tsunami. Today it is one of the few organizations working inside Syria and Libya. Aossey shared stories and lessons learned from nearly three decades of responding to emergencies, training local health care workers and preparing communities to respond to future shocks. This approach of training and building long-term resilience, even in disaster zones, was viewed as impossible 30 years ago when International Medical Corps launched its first mission. Today, it is the model, accepted as a culturally appropriate, economically efficient and politically stabilizing way to deliver humanitarian assistance worldwide.\nLecture co-hosted by the USC Institute for Global Health and International Medical Corps.\n\nMaterials with copyright have been adapted and are licensed under the license CC BY http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/, 'Nancy Aossey: \"On the Front Lines of Disaster: Building Resilient Communities\"', by Institute for Global Health, on line on https://vimeo.com/93651451\n\nSubscribe via:\nwww.youtube.com/alainderaymond\n\nMore info on:\nhttp://globalhealth.usc.edu/nancyaossey\nhttps://vimeo.com/uscglobalhealth",

In 1994 as the California earthquake hit our community, we began a new service which was providing Emergency water damage to the entire LA and Ventura area. We begun working directly with the home owner insurance in order to not burden the insured(s)financially and had kept an excellent record with both the customer/insured and every related party on the insurance side. Regal Carpet had integrated with Regal Restoration in 2008 and is considered to be one of the busiest company in the San Fernando Valley! We work by word of mouth referral, repeat customers and local advertizing. Our data base is over 70,000 customers long and counting.\n\nBusiness Owner\nDanny Forster, Owner of Regal Carpet/Restoration has been in the same business since 1989. Started as a helper in a carpet cleaning company and promoted to a technician the following day...A couple of years of the steady job later the company was purchased by Danny and the name Regal Carpet became in 1993. Good work, follow-up and fair prices had kept the company going up to current date. The water damage and mold remediation had grown to multiple 16 feet trucks and the operation is daily. Danny believes that to keep the company running all that takes is good work and low prices but to get the constant referrals you got to do",

      "description": "For the Chinese government, the 2008 Olympics in Beijing were designed to be the moment when China took its rightful place on the international stage. Beijing spared no effort or expense to ensure this goal was achieved, spending billions to modernize the face of the capital, building stunning athletic venues, and investing all its prestige to make the Games an affirmation of China's new wealth and power.\n\nIn its bid to win the Games, Beijing also pledged to allow a freer atmosphere for the international press, and as the Olympics approached,  long-standing restrictions on the movements and activities of foreign correspondents were lifted.  Reporters for American and other international media suddenly found themselves able to travel freely, conduct interviews, and operate in an atmosphere that was more relaxed and welcoming than many had ever seen.\n\nYet as the Games approached, two traumatic events reshaped the narrative of the China story. Anti-Chinese riots in Tibet embarrassed the authorities, and widespread public anger in China at the way  American and other western covered the disturbances triggered an ugly wave of hostility towards the foreign media. Soon after came a devastating earthquake in Sichuan, which killed nearly 70,000 people. In sharp contrast to previous disasters, foreign correspondents were allowed immediate and extensive access to the worst-hit areas, and the sympathetic coverage led to an abrupt shift among many Chinese to a more positive view of the international media.\n\nAnd neither crisis detracted from the extraordinary success of the Olympics themselves, although many foreign corespondents chafed at the restrictions and manipulation they faced while the Games were underway.\n\n\"Tremors\" is an account of what it was like to  cover the remarkable year of 2008.\n\n*****\n\nAssignment: China is a signature project of the USC U.S.-China Institute. Most Americans continue to learn about China primarily through the media and we feel that it is vital to understand the process by which news about China is gathered and shared. Mike Chinoy, USCI senior fellow, reports the series which is filmed and edited by Craig Stubing. Clayton Dube conceived of the project and oversees it. Many students and volunteers assist with research, transcription, and translation.",

      "description": "The Boeing X48 - Nasa Experimental Unmanned Aerial Vehicle\n\nChannel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfU3rEfgNExlKG4Uc4mo5cQ/\nBloG:  http://inventiontv.blogspot.com/\nGoogle +: https://plus.google.com/u/0/b/110939505282711218297/110939505282711218297\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Invention-tv-1698034360414836/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/INventionTVTW/media\nSubscribe: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCfU3rEfgNExlKG4Uc4mo5cQ?sub_confirmation=1\n\nThe Boeing X-48 is an experimental unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) for investigation into the characteristics of blended wing body (BWB) aircraft, a type of flying wing. Boeing designed the X-48 and two examples were built by Cranfield Aerospace in the UK. Boeing began flight testing the X-48B version for NASA in 2007. The X-48B was later modified into the X-48C version. It was flight tested from August 2012 to April 2013. Boeing and NASA plan to develop a larger BWB demonstrator.\n\n\nX-48\nResearch at Phantom Works then focused on a new model, designated X-48B, two examples were built by United Kingdom-based Cranfield Aerospace. Norman Princen, Boeing's chief engineer for the project, stated in 2006: \"Earlier wind-tunnel testing and the upcoming flight testing are focused on learning more about the BWB's low-speed flight-control characteristics, especially during takeoffs and landings. Knowing how accurately our models predict these characteristics is an important step in the further development of this concept.\"\n\nThe X-48B has a 21-foot (6.4 m) wingspan, weighs 392-pound (178 kg), and is built from composite materials. It is powered by three small turbojet engines and is expected to fly at up to 120 kn (220 km/h) and reach an altitude of 10,000 feet (3,000 m). The X-48B is an 8.5% scaled version of a conceptual 240-foot wide design. Though passenger versions of the X-48B have been proposed, the design has a higher probability of first being used for a military transport.\n\nThe X-48C featuring two engines and inboard vertical stabilizers\nWind tunnel testing on a 12 ft wide blended wing body model was completed in September 2005.[ During April and May 2006, NASA performed wind tunnel tests on X-48B Ship 1 at a facility shared by Langley and Old Dominion University. After the wind tunnel testing, the vehicle was shipped to NASA's Dryden Flight Research Center at Edwards Air Force Base to serve as a backup to X-48B Ship 2 for flight testing. X-48B Ship 2 then conducted ground tests and taxi testing in preparation for flight. In November 2006, ground testing began at Dryden, to validate the aircraft's systems integrity, telemetry and communications links, flight-control software and taxi and takeoff characteristics.\n\nThe second X-48B was modified into the X-48C starting in 2010 for further flight tests.[18] The X-48C has its vertical stabilizers moved inboard on either side of the engines, and its fuselage extended aft, both in an attempt to reduce the aircraft's noise profile; it was to be powered by two JetCat turbines, each producing 80 pounds-force (0.36 kN) of thrust.The X-48C was instead modified to use two Advanced Micro Turbo (AMT) turbojet engines in 2012.\n\nFollowing flight testing of the X-48C in April 2013, Boeing and NASA announced plans to develop a larger BWB demonstrator capable of transonic flight.\n\nVariants\nX-48A\nThe initial planned 35 ft (10.7 m) wide version. It was canceled before manufacture.\nX-48B\nTwo 8.5% scale aircraft that have been used for flight testing.\nX-48C\nA modified, two-engine version of the X-48B intended to test a low-noise design\n\nSpecifications (X-48B)\nWingspan: 20 ft 5 in (6.22 m)\nWing area: 100.5 sq ft (9.34 m2)\nAspect ratio: 4.1\nGross weight: 500 lb (227 kg)\nPowerplant: 3 × JetCat P200 turbojet, 52 lbf (0.23 kN) thrust each\nMaximum speed: 136 mph; 219 km/h (118 kn)\nEndurance: 40 minutes\nService ceiling: 10,000 ft (3,048 m)",

      "description": "The San Andreas Fault is the world's longest earthquake fault, stretching more than 800 miles through California, into the Pacific Ocean. I recorded this video while walking along The Sawyer Camp Trail, a San Mateo County Park. The deer in this video are a prime example of hidden dangers amidst the natural beauty of this area of the San Andreas Fault.  Anytime you can see deer in this area, you can be certain that mountain lions are also in the immediate vicinity.  This is mountain lion territory and deer are the main source of food for mountain lions. Hikers are warned never to walk alone on The Sawyer Camp Trail, as well as on all San Mateo County Park Trails.",

      "description": "See more at http://ybca.org/work-progress\n\nEmerging from a desire to create a dynamic, nontraditional experiment in our galleries, Work in Progress: Investigations South of Market forefronts the process of art making and opens up a conversation about site, both within and beyond YBCA’s doors. Responding to a prompt from YBCA, six artists take a unique point of departure from which to explore the SOMA neighborhood. Inspirations include the events that have shaped the neighborhood including the 1906 earthquake and fire, which physically and psychologically transformed the landscape of San Francisco, the more recent changes that have come about since the opening of AT&T Park in 2000, and the environmental impacts of the building boom. Other projects look at the people who have inhabited the neighborhood over the years, from the Ohlone to the wealthy landowners of the 19th century to those who work and live here today.\n\nWork in Progress is an examination of place, artistic practice, and space. For the project, we invited a group of artists to submit proposals that address San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood through research-based inquiry. The selected participants—Terry Berlier, Val Britton, Tom Loughlin, Jenny Odell, Stadium Projects (Joshua Peder Stulen, Monte Masi, and Lex Kosieradzki), and Weston Teruya—have been grouped into three sequential residencies, and the galleries are effectively becoming a working studio for them during their time at YBCA. As each residency rotates out, the works produced remain on site, with each residency building on the last and presenting a new layer of the cumulative experience.\n\nYBCA’s neighborhood has long been a locus of change, contention, and renewal. The newly commissioned works for this exhibition aim to deepen our understanding of, and connect back to, this rich history and legacy. Even as the artists investigate a specific locale within San Francisco, they also look beyond it, exploring broader themes of generosity, urban planning, environmental impact, and historical change.",

Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways. A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\nEntertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.

You can also connect with plumbers on the website and get an estimate from a qualified, local plumber.  \nTips.\nTip #1 - Great plumbers have great reviews\nTip #2 - Hire a plumber that is licensed, bonded and insured.\nTip #3 - Make sure the plumbing service provides a warranty.\nWater heaters usually last around 10 years and leaking water heaters is an indicator you should replace the unit.  If the unit is not working, it may be cheaper to fix than to replace.  Common replacements include thermocouple, controller board replacement and pilot light replacement.  It will cost around $300 to one of these services done.  \nThe total price you pay will include parts, labor and permits.  The city may require a permit and you may have additional fees if you need modifications to be compliant with city code. Other costs may include haul away to remove the unit, earthquake straps to hold the unit in pace, and insulation around the pipes. \nQuestions to ask the plumber. What is the total cost or replacement including taxes and removal of the old unit? How long will it take to complete the project and when can it be done.  Is your company licensed, bonded and insured? Do you offer a warranty?  What brand of parts will be used and what warranty is offered by the manufacturer? \nPlumbers are usually available in the evening or weekends to deal with emergencies.  \nService Areas: Capitola, Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley, Watsonville, Aptos, Boulder Creek, Davenport, La Selva Beach, Live Oak, Soquel.\n\nRelated Videos.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYLnbsrzD0o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl6lO_CBWyZlZEb_Pt8EHmw2Uy8b0_39F\nhttps://vimeo.com/147199823\n\nPlease subscribe to our channel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ptj6odh_fB9HybkGJXq_A\nMake sure to like this video and add your comments below.\nVisit our website.\nhttp://contractor.astriden.com/plumber/hot-water-heater-replacement-cost-santa-cruz.html",

      "description": "#darkscreensmatter\n\n#screensgodark \n\n\nA San Francisco man accused of burglarizing an apartment last May was acquitted earlier this week after his attorneys successfully argued that the suspect was actually attempting to board a spaceship he thought was on its roof.\nPublic defender Jeff Adachi told the court that Santonio Aviles, 41, was suffering meth-induced psychosis and believed the end of the world was nigh, CBS San Francisco reports.\nAviles somehow convinced a resident of the building to let him into the complex. Once inside, he climbed onto the fire escape and found an open window that he used to enter an apartment and take a short nap.\nWhen Aviles awoke, he threw an inflatable exercise ball onto the fire escape figuring he could use it as transportation into the next galaxy. He also stole a backpack from the apartment and loaded it with a passport and earthquake kit, SFGate.com reports.\nThe passport wasn't Aviles'. It belonged to a woman who, like him, had long dark hair. Aviles testified that he believed the passport would ensure his seat on the spaceship, according to a release by the San Francisco Public Defender's Office.\nAt some point while Aviles was getting ready to leave Earth forever, the apartment resident and his girlfriend woke up to see a strange man in their home.\nThe resident tackled Aviles and began punching while the woman hit the suspect with a baseball bat. Then the pair called 911.\nAviles suffered a black eye and various bruises, scratches and scrapes, according to the release. The man who lived in the apartment suffered an injured toe and developed a rash from the encounter.\nDuring the trial, public defender Jacque Wilson argued that Aviles did not enter the building to rob or hurt anyone, but was suffering a meth-induced mental health crisis, according to SFist.com.\n\nPlease donate to my paypal account so I can continue to bring you news of the day & the paranormal at :\n\nhttp://theguyfrompittsburgh.boardhost.com/\n\nPlease look at our crowdfunding page at :\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/openlinesgerry",

      "description": "A strong storm system ushers in unsettled, stormy weather to California, including us here in San Jose/Milpitas, CA!  Strong winds, heavy rain, thunder, lightning and hail were all observed on this day alone.  Talk about El Niño finally settling in!\n\nWeather summary and scenario:\nAfter being battered with rain and strong winds the prior week, the Bay Area was again hit with yet another storm system, which arrived Sunday, December 13, 2015.  This system came on the heels of a storm that already had struck the region with rain, lightning, strong winds and hail.  This next storm had delivered a similar scenario to the San Francisco Bay Area... Additionally, wind advisories were issued for the Bay Area due to wind gusts possibly reaching 40-50 mph.  Power outages were also possible during the period.  By the way, a very brief power outage actually had taken place during our Sunday morning worship!  That was when the strong cold front from this system was passing thru with gusty winds and rains...\n\nSpeaking of the weather, our weather here in San Jose, CA was as follows:  A frontal system had moved thru.  The front was preceded by strong southerly winds accompanying heavy rainfall during the a.m. hours.  Spotty t-storms have later occurred in the afternoon due to an unstable airmass behind the passing strong cold front of this system.  One decent storm cell had went directly over us while we were stuck in traffic, on the way to Great Mall in Milpitas, CA!  That was intense indeed!  Windswept heavy rain, hail, thunder and lightning were all observed.  Surely, this 3rd winter-like storm in a week had brought more beneficial rain and snow to much of NorCal.  Rainfall amounts were to range from 1-2 inches across the North Bay with generally 1/2-1 inch around the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area.  For the remainder of the area... a half inch or less was forecast.  Also, a strong El Niño could still drench California in the upcoming winter months.  Keep those umbrellas handy!",

      "title": "BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN RAILROAD - FULL RIDE POV+ REACTIONS - DISNEYLAND",
      "description": "A peak at our vacation in Disneyland (Vlogs are still being edited but will be out soon!) Here is our first ride at Disneyland on Big Thunder Mountain Railroad.\n\nBig Thunder Mountain Railroad is an indoor/outdoor mine train roller coaster located in Frontierland at several Disneyland-style Disney Parks worldwide. The ride exists at Disneyland Park (California) and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and at Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Park (Paris) as Big Thunder Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is also the name of the fictional rail line the roller coaster depicts.\nWhile the design of the Walt Disney World version of this roller coaster was done first, Disneyland's version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was the first one built. The track layout was mirrored, placing the attraction to the right of Rivers of America, if viewed from the central hub. (In Walt Disney World, the attraction is located to the left of Rivers of America.) To better fit with the adjacent Fantasyland areas of the theme park, the original Walt Disney World design had to be replaced with something more appropriate for Disneyland. The original design featured sharp-edged mountains and vibrant colors of Monument Valley, Arizona. Instead, Disneyland's version was developed with more rounded features and muted colors resembling the Bryce Canyon hoodoos in Utah.\n\nUpon entering the attraction, the queue winds through a narrow rock wall and passing by the tracks. The surrounding walls were originally created from 100 tons of gold ore from Rosamond.\n\nLeaving the outdoor station, trains enter a tunnel, make a right hand turn, then a left hand turn before climbing the first lift hill, which takes trains through a cavern full of stalactites. Leaving the lift hill, the train drops away to the right, then levels out and makes a left hand turn. The track then crosses under the second lift hill drop before making a right hand turn. The sounds of coyotes can be heard as the train descends into a long, dark tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, the train hits a trim brake, exits the tunnel, and climbs the second lift hill. At the top of the lift, an animatronic goat bleats at passing guests as the train drops away to the right, crosses under the lift hill, and rises up into a downward spiraling clockwise helix. Leaving the helix, the train shoots through a small canyon, then drops down into a mining camp, where it hits another trim brake. The train then makes a left hand turn, enters another tunnel, and climbs the third lift hill. As the train climbs the lift, the tunnel is dynamited, and artificial smoke is blasted in guests' faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel. The train then drops to the right, towards the river, then makes a right hand turn and passes through a short tunnel. After crossing over the drop, the trains make a left hand turn as they pass through the ribcage of a T-rex skeleton, hit a trim brake, then make a right hand turn into the final brakes. The train then travels by the buildings of Rainbow Ridge as it returns to the station.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the ride was closed for an extensive refurbishment that included a new track, trains, scenery, and new effects on the third lift hill. The attraction reopened on March 17, 2014. The new track was fabricated by Dynamic Structures, the company that had previously rehauled the coaster track in Space Mountain.\nAlthough the details of the backstory vary from park to park, all follow the same general story arcs. Some time in the late 1800s, gold was discovered on Big Thunder Mountain in the American Southwest. Overnight, a small mining town became a thriving mining town (the name of the town varies from ride to ride. In the California ride, the town is known as Rainbow Ridge. In the Florida version, the town is known as Tumbleweed, and in Paris, the town is known as Thunder Mesa.). Mining was prosperous, and an extensive line of mine trains was set up to transport the ore. Unknown to the settlers, the Mountain was a sacred spot to local Native Americans and was cursed.\n\nBefore long, the settlers' desecration of the mountain caused a great tragedy, which, depending on the park, is usually depicted to be an earthquake (in the Paris and California versions of the ride), a tsunami (in the Tokyo version of the ride), a flash flood (in the Florida version of the ride), which befell the mines and town, and the town was abandoned. Some time later, the locomotives were found to be racing around the mountain on their own, without engineers or a crew. The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was founded in the old mining camp to allow tourists to take rides on the possessed trains.\n\nInspired by real-life Bryce Canyon, the Hoodoos of Big Thunder in Disneyland as seen from the Big Thunder Trail that passes behind the ride.",

      "title": "BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN RAILROAD - FULL RIDE POV - DISNEYLAND",
      "description": "Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is an indoor/outdoor mine train roller coaster located in Frontierland at several Disneyland-style Disney Parks worldwide. The ride exists at Disneyland Park (California) and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and at Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Park (Paris) as Big Thunder Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is also the name of the fictional rail line the roller coaster depicts.\nWhile the design of the Walt Disney World version of this roller coaster was done first, Disneyland's version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was the first one built. The track layout was mirrored, placing the attraction to the right of Rivers of America, if viewed from the central hub. (In Walt Disney World, the attraction is located to the left of Rivers of America.) To better fit with the adjacent Fantasyland areas of the theme park, the original Walt Disney World design had to be replaced with something more appropriate for Disneyland. The original design featured sharp-edged mountains and vibrant colors of Monument Valley, Arizona. Instead, Disneyland's version was developed with more rounded features and muted colors resembling the Bryce Canyon hoodoos in Utah.\n\nUpon entering the attraction, the queue winds through a narrow rock wall and passing by the tracks. The surrounding walls were originally created from 100 tons of gold ore from Rosamond.\n\nLeaving the outdoor station, trains enter a tunnel, make a right hand turn, then a left hand turn before climbing the first lift hill, which takes trains through a cavern full of stalactites. Leaving the lift hill, the train drops away to the right, then levels out and makes a left hand turn. The track then crosses under the second lift hill drop before making a right hand turn. The sounds of coyotes can be heard as the train descends into a long, dark tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, the train hits a trim brake, exits the tunnel, and climbs the second lift hill. At the top of the lift, an animatronic goat bleats at passing guests as the train drops away to the right, crosses under the lift hill, and rises up into a downward spiraling clockwise helix. Leaving the helix, the train shoots through a small canyon, then drops down into a mining camp, where it hits another trim brake. The train then makes a left hand turn, enters another tunnel, and climbs the third lift hill. As the train climbs the lift, the tunnel is dynamited, and artificial smoke is blasted in guests' faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel. The train then drops to the right, towards the river, then makes a right hand turn and passes through a short tunnel. After crossing over the drop, the trains make a left hand turn as they pass through the ribcage of a T-rex skeleton, hit a trim brake, then make a right hand turn into the final brakes. The train then travels by the buildings of Rainbow Ridge as it returns to the station.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the ride was closed for an extensive refurbishment that included a new track, trains, scenery, and new effects on the third lift hill. The attraction reopened on March 17, 2014. The new track was fabricated by Dynamic Structures, the company that had previously rehauled the coaster track in Space Mountain.\nAlthough the details of the backstory vary from park to park, all follow the same general story arcs. Some time in the late 1800s, gold was discovered on Big Thunder Mountain in the American Southwest. Overnight, a small mining town became a thriving mining town (the name of the town varies from ride to ride. In the California ride, the town is known as Rainbow Ridge. In the Florida version, the town is known as Tumbleweed, and in Paris, the town is known as Thunder Mesa.[1]). Mining was prosperous, and an extensive line of mine trains was set up to transport the ore. Unknown to the settlers, the Mountain was a sacred spot to local Native Americans and was cursed.[2]\n\nBefore long, the settlers' desecration of the mountain caused a great tragedy, which, depending on the park, is usually depicted to be an earthquake (in the Paris and California versions of the ride), a tsunami (in the Tokyo version of the ride), a flash flood (in the Florida version of the ride), which befell the mines and town, and the town was abandoned. Some time later, the locomotives were found to be racing around the mountain on their own, without engineers or a crew. The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was founded in the old mining camp to allow tourists to take rides on the possessed trains.\n\n\nInspired by real-life Bryce Canyon, the Hoodoos of Big Thunder in Disneyland as seen from the Big Thunder Trail that passes behind the ride.",

      "description": "Solutions to humanitarian disasters: International Medical Corps by Nancy Aossey\n\nTuesday, March 11, 2014\nUSC Global Health Lecture Series 2013-2014\nUniversity of Southern California\nWorking on the frontlines of the world’s worst humanitarian disasters, International Medical Corps President and CEO Nancy Aossey and her colleagues were in Rwanda as the genocide unfolded, treating patients amid unimaginable brutality; in Somalia at the height of the civil war and famine, training local health workers amid the chaos; and in the Balkans during the ethnic cleansing, establishing emergency medicine and ambulance infrastructure. In recent years, International Medical Corps has been a first-responder to the Indian Ocean tsunami, Haiti earthquake and Japan earthquake and tsunami. Today it is one of the few organizations working inside Syria and Libya. Aossey shared stories and lessons learned from nearly three decades of responding to emergencies, training local health care workers and preparing communities to respond to future shocks. This approach of training and building long-term resilience, even in disaster zones, was viewed as impossible 30 years ago when International Medical Corps launched its first mission. Today, it is the model, accepted as a culturally appropriate, economically efficient and politically stabilizing way to deliver humanitarian assistance worldwide.\nLecture co-hosted by the USC Institute for Global Health and International Medical Corps.\n\nMaterials with copyright have been adapted and are licensed under the license CC BY http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/, 'Nancy Aossey: \"On the Front Lines of Disaster: Building Resilient Communities\"', by Institute for Global Health, on line on https://vimeo.com/93651451\n\nSubscribe via:\nwww.youtube.com/alainderaymond\n\nMore info on:\nhttp://globalhealth.usc.edu/nancyaossey\nhttps://vimeo.com/uscglobalhealth",

      "title": "BIG THUNDER MOUNTAIN RAILROAD - FULL RIDE POV - DISNEYLAND",
      "description": "Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is an indoor/outdoor mine train roller coaster located in Frontierland at several Disneyland-style Disney Parks worldwide. The ride exists at Disneyland Park (California) and the Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World as Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and at Tokyo Disneyland and Disneyland Park (Paris) as Big Thunder Mountain. Big Thunder Mountain Railroad is also the name of the fictional rail line the roller coaster depicts.\nWhile the design of the Walt Disney World version of this roller coaster was done first, Disneyland's version of Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was the first one built. The track layout was mirrored, placing the attraction to the right of Rivers of America, if viewed from the central hub. (In Walt Disney World, the attraction is located to the left of Rivers of America.) To better fit with the adjacent Fantasyland areas of the theme park, the original Walt Disney World design had to be replaced with something more appropriate for Disneyland. The original design featured sharp-edged mountains and vibrant colors of Monument Valley, Arizona. Instead, Disneyland's version was developed with more rounded features and muted colors resembling the Bryce Canyon hoodoos in Utah.\n\nUpon entering the attraction, the queue winds through a narrow rock wall and passing by the tracks. The surrounding walls were originally created from 100 tons of gold ore from Rosamond.\n\nLeaving the outdoor station, trains enter a tunnel, make a right hand turn, then a left hand turn before climbing the first lift hill, which takes trains through a cavern full of stalactites. Leaving the lift hill, the train drops away to the right, then levels out and makes a left hand turn. The track then crosses under the second lift hill drop before making a right hand turn. The sounds of coyotes can be heard as the train descends into a long, dark tunnel. At the end of the tunnel, the train hits a trim brake, exits the tunnel, and climbs the second lift hill. At the top of the lift, an animatronic goat bleats at passing guests as the train drops away to the right, crosses under the lift hill, and rises up into a downward spiraling clockwise helix. Leaving the helix, the train shoots through a small canyon, then drops down into a mining camp, where it hits another trim brake. The train then makes a left hand turn, enters another tunnel, and climbs the third lift hill. As the train climbs the lift, the tunnel is dynamited, and artificial smoke is blasted in guests' faces as the train crests the lift and exits the tunnel. The train then drops to the right, towards the river, then makes a right hand turn and passes through a short tunnel. After crossing over the drop, the trains make a left hand turn as they pass through the ribcage of a T-rex skeleton, hit a trim brake, then make a right hand turn into the final brakes. The train then travels by the buildings of Rainbow Ridge as it returns to the station.\n\nOn January 7, 2013, the ride was closed for an extensive refurbishment that included a new track, trains, scenery, and new effects on the third lift hill. The attraction reopened on March 17, 2014. The new track was fabricated by Dynamic Structures, the company that had previously rehauled the coaster track in Space Mountain.\nAlthough the details of the backstory vary from park to park, all follow the same general story arcs. Some time in the late 1800s, gold was discovered on Big Thunder Mountain in the American Southwest. Overnight, a small mining town became a thriving mining town (the name of the town varies from ride to ride. In the California ride, the town is known as Rainbow Ridge. In the Florida version, the town is known as Tumbleweed, and in Paris, the town is known as Thunder Mesa.[1]). Mining was prosperous, and an extensive line of mine trains was set up to transport the ore. Unknown to the settlers, the Mountain was a sacred spot to local Native Americans and was cursed.[2]\n\nBefore long, the settlers' desecration of the mountain caused a great tragedy, which, depending on the park, is usually depicted to be an earthquake (in the Paris and California versions of the ride), a tsunami (in the Tokyo version of the ride), a flash flood (in the Florida version of the ride), which befell the mines and town, and the town was abandoned. Some time later, the locomotives were found to be racing around the mountain on their own, without engineers or a crew. The Big Thunder Mountain Railroad was founded in the old mining camp to allow tourists to take rides on the possessed trains.\n\n\nInspired by real-life Bryce Canyon, the Hoodoos of Big Thunder in Disneyland as seen from the Big Thunder Trail that passes behind the ride.",

In 1994 as the California earthquake hit our community, we began a new service which was providing Emergency water damage to the entire LA and Ventura area. We begun working directly with the home owner insurance in order to not burden the insured(s)financially and had kept an excellent record with both the customer/insured and every related party on the insurance side. Regal Carpet had integrated with Regal Restoration in 2008 and is considered to be one of the busiest company in the San Fernando Valley! We work by word of mouth referral, repeat customers and local advertizing.

Started as a helper in a carpet cleaning company and promoted to a technician the following day...A couple of years of the steady job later the company was purchased by Danny and the name Regal Carpet became in 1993. Good work, follow-up and fair prices had kept the company going up to current date. The water damage and mold remediation had grown to multiple 16 feet trucks and the operation is daily. Danny believes that to keep the company running all that takes is good work and low prices but to get the constant referrals you got to do",

Supernatural giftings; ones that are given to you by the Holy Spirit that will edify not only others but yourself as well,\nJohn 12;32\n32 And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men unto me.\n\n3.

      "title": "Assignment: China - Tremors",
      "description": "For the Chinese government, the 2008 Olympics in Beijing were designed to be the moment when China took its rightful place on the international stage. Beijing spared no effort or expense to ensure this goal was achieved, spending billions to modernize the face of the capital, building stunning athletic venues, and investing all its prestige to make the Games an affirmation of China's new wealth and power.\n\nIn its bid to win the Games, Beijing also pledged to allow a freer atmosphere for the international press, and as the Olympics approached,  long-standing restrictions on the movements and activities of foreign correspondents were lifted.  Reporters for American and other international media suddenly found themselves able to travel freely, conduct interviews, and operate in an atmosphere that was more relaxed and welcoming than many had ever seen.\n\nYet as the Games approached, two traumatic events reshaped the narrative of the China story. Anti-Chinese riots in Tibet embarrassed the authorities, and widespread public anger in China at the way  American and other western covered the disturbances triggered an ugly wave of hostility towards the foreign media. Soon after came a devastating earthquake in Sichuan, which killed nearly 70,000 people. In sharp contrast to previous disasters, foreign correspondents were allowed immediate and extensive access to the worst-hit areas, and the sympathetic coverage led to an abrupt shift among many Chinese to a more positive view of the international media.\n\nAnd neither crisis detracted from the extraordinary success of the Olympics themselves, although many foreign corespondents chafed at the restrictions and manipulation they faced while the Games were underway.\n\n\"Tremors\" is an account of what it was like to  cover the remarkable year of 2008.\n\n*****\n\nAssignment: China is a signature project of the USC U.S.-China Institute. Most Americans continue to learn about China primarily through the media and we feel that it is vital to understand the process by which news about China is gathered and shared. Mike Chinoy, USCI senior fellow, reports the series which is filmed and edited by Craig Stubing. Clayton Dube conceived of the project and oversees it. Many students and volunteers assist with research, transcription, and translation.",

      "description": "http://www.freemusicteacher.com/  \nPiano Tutorial by Ramin Yousefi\nHow To Play Piano: Michael Jackson \"Will You Be There\"\nYou Can Learn Piano From Basic to Advance by Watching These Music Clips\n\"Will You Be There\" is a song by Michael Jackson which was released in 1993. The song is the eighth single from the 1991 album Dangerous. The song also appeared on the soundtrack to the film Free Willy, of which it is the main theme.\n\nThe song was one of the biggest hits from Dangerous, staying in the top 40 for over six weeks in the UK. The single achieved even greater success in the U.S., where it sold 500,000 copies and stayed in the top ten for six weeks, peaking at number seven and earning a gold certification.\nThe song is written in the key of D Major. Jackson's vocal spans from D3 to Eb5. It has a tempo of 83 beats per minute. Michael wrote and produced Will You Be There – with co-producing credits going to Bruce Swedien – and orchestrated the rhythm and vocal arrangements. Featured instruments are noted as piano, synthesizer, keyboard, drums, and percussion. In 2002 he told an ITV documentary it was written at his Neverland ranch, in what he calls his Giving Tree: \"I've written so many of my songs in this tree. I wrote... Will You Be There...\" (Living with Michael Jackson, aired Feb 2003).\nMichael Jackson performed \"Will You Be There\" live throughout the Dangerous World Tour. Outside of the tour, Jackson performed the song at the MTV 10th anniversary show and at the NAACP Image Awards in 1993. A version was released on the 2004 DVD Live in Bucharest: The Dangerous Tour. Jackson would have performed the song for the \"This Is It\" concerts which never took place due to his sudden death. It was not featured in the film This Is It (although it appears briefly on the DVD/Blu-ray bonus features), but was confirmed to have been part of the concert, along with \"Dirty Diana\", \"Dangerous\", \"Rock with You\", \"You Are Not Alone\", \"You Rock My World\", \"Heal the World\" and \"Stranger in Moscow\", which were also not seen in the film.\nJennifer Hudson performed the song at Michael Jackson's memorial service on July 7, 2009.\n\nThe song was also covered by the band Boyce Avenue on their 2010 album Influential Sessions. Sales of this song on iTunes were used to raise money for relief of the 2010 Haiti earthquake through the American Red Cross. Band member Alejandro Manzano said \"...though we knew that any cover of [Michael Jackson's] music would pale in comparison to the original, we were still compelled to give a shout out to the late great in this time of need, by doing our rendition of one of our favorite songs of his, 'Will You Be There.'\"\n\nMichael Lynche performed the song on the ninth season of American Idol on May 11, 2010, prior to being eliminated from the Final 4.\n\nFleur East performed the song on the eleventh season of The X Factor (UK) on November 8, 2014, during Queen vs. Michael Jackson week.",

      "title": "How To Play Piano: \"I Don't Want To\"  by Toni Michele Braxton",
      "description": "http://www.freemusicteacher.com/  \nPiano Tutorial by Ramin Yousefi\nHow To Play Piano: \"I Don't Want To\"  by Toni Michele Braxton \nYou Can Learn Piano From Basic to Advance by Watching These Music Clips\n\"I Don't Want To\" is a song by American R&B singer Toni Braxton, released as the third single from her second studio album, Secrets (1996). Written and produced by R. Kelly, this ballad describes the agony of a break-up. The single—released in the U.S. as a double A-side with the airplay smash hit \"I Love Me Some Him\"—shot to number 19 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 9 on the Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs during the summer of 1997. While not as successful as the two preceding singles, it became her third consecutive chart-topper on the Billboard Hot Dance Club Play in July 1997, following \"You're Makin' Me High\" and \"Un-Break My Heart\".\n\nThe music video was shot during a hectic time in Braxton's career. After the commercial success from the preceding singles and co-headlining a tour with Kenny G., Braxton was exhausted. The time schedule for a video was roughly one day for director Billie Woodruff. A simple video featured Braxton wandering around in a white room wearing a white tanktop, blue jeans & a built up shoe.\n\nThe original treatment for the video was a one-take version. Woodruff told MTV News that he shot multiple takes and at the end of the day, the best version would be picked. The video had Braxton walking around a house, trying on various wigs and scrubbing her feet in a bathtub. Oddly enough, this was the controversy when creating the video. This video remains unreleased but MTV aired a short \"making of\" during editions of MTV News.\nToni Michele Braxton (born October 7, 1967) is an American R&B singer-songwriter, pianist, record producer, actress, television personality, and philanthropist. Rising to fame in the beginning of the 1990s, Braxton quickly established herself as an R&B icon and became one of the best-selling female artists of the 1990s decade, garnering her honorific titles such as the \"Queen of R&B\" and being recognized as one of the most outstanding voices of this generation.\n\nHer self-titled debut studio album was released in 1993. It sold over 10 million copies worldwide, spawning such hits as \"Another Sad Love Song\" and \"Breathe Again\" and earning Braxton three Grammy Awards, including Best New Artist. Released in 1996, her second album, Secrets, continued her acclaim and mega success, selling over 15 million copies globally. The album spawned the Billboard Hot 100 No. 1 hits \"You're Makin' Me High\" and \"Un-Break My Heart\", which became her signature song and the second top-selling single of all time by a female artist. Braxton won two Grammy Awards for Secrets. In 2000, her third album, The Heat, was released. It sold over 4 million copies and included the hit single \"He Wasn't Man Enough\", for which Braxton won a Grammy Award. She then released three more studio albums – More Than A Woman (2002), Libra (2005) and Pulse (2010), experiencing personal and label conflicts in between these releases. In 2014, Braxton and long-time collaborator Babyface released a duet album entitled Love, Marriage & Divorce, which earned the duo a Grammy Award in early 2015.\n\nThroughout her career, Braxton has sold over 67 million records, including 41 million albums, worldwide. She has won seven Grammy Awards, nine Billboard Music Awards, seven American Music Awards and several other awards. Aside from her success in music, Braxton has become a television executive producer and personality, being involved in the 7th season of the reality show Dancing with the Stars and in a reality series entitled Braxton Family Values, where Braxton is Executive Producer and star since 2011 on WE tv. Braxton is also an Executive Producer of the spin-off show, starring her younger sister, Tamar-The Tamar & Vince show on WE tv. On September 18, 2011, Braxton was inducted into the Georgia Music Hall of Fame.",

Then I heard one of the four living creatures say in a voice like thunder, “Come!” 2 I looked, and there before me was a white horse! Its rider held a bow, and he was given a crown, and he rode out as a conqueror bent on conquest.\n\nhorses riding in 2016\n\nhorses of religion - \ndecline of Christianity, and the remnant will be forced to go possibly underground,\nthe pope will make some shocking statements, and several catholic leaders will leave.\n\nhorses of currency\nmore banks will go bankrupt, and more deaths of bankers.\nmerging of larger banks while small ones will fold.\ncredit cards will become fewer and other devices will be replaced, such as the palm device. all in preparation of the chip that will ultimately replace money as we know it.\n\n5 When the Lamb opened the third seal, I heard the third living creature say, “Come!” I looked, and there before me was a black horse! Its rider was holding a pair of scales in his hand. 6 Then I heard what sounded like a voice among the four living creatures, saying, “Two pounds[a] of wheat for a day’s wages,[b] and six pounds[c] of barley for a day’s wages,[d] and do not damage the oil and the wine!”\n\nhorses of war - tension will build, at the door\n\n3 When the Lamb opened the second seal, I heard the second living creature say, “Come!” 4 Then another horse came out, a fiery red one. Its rider was given power to take peace from the earth and to make people kill each other. To him was given a large sword.\n\nhorses of death\npresident assassination attempt, if this happens a head wound, and comes back, this will be an ultimate sign to the believers\n\nhorses of weather \ncoldest and hottest\nearthquakes the Midwest fault\n\n12 I watched as he opened the sixth seal. There was a great earthquake. The sun turned black like sackcloth made of goat hair, the whole moon turned blood red, 13 and the stars in the sky fell to earth, as figs drop from a fig tree when shaken by a strong wind. 14 The heavens receded like a scroll being rolled up, and every mountain and island was removed from its place.\nvolcanoes\n\nsun moon and stars, signs more and more. the axis will be shifting more.\n\nhorses of health; \ndiseases will increase and children seniors will feel it the most.\n\nIslam will be introduced in the public school systems and they will be given time to pray while the Christians will not.\n\nhttp://www.susanwaldrop.org\nprayer@susanwaldrop.org\npraise@susanwaldrop.org",

      "description": "Chile has evacuated one million residents along its coastline, following a powerful earthquake that caused buildings to sway in the South American country.\nThe quake, with a magnitude of 8.3, struck around 144 miles north-west of the capital Santiago.\nIt also triggered tsunami waves of up to 4.5 metres in some places.\nFive people have died and at least one person has been reported missing, officials say.\nThe tremor struck at 10.54pm (British time) on Wednesday night, the US Geological Survey said. Several strong aftershocks were reported just minutes later.\nAddressing the nation live on TV, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said she would travel to the affected areas later on Thursday.\nTsunami alerts were also issued for Peru, Hawaii, parts of California and as far away as New Zealand.\nChile is one of the most seismically active locations on the globe.\nIt runs along the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. These are massive slabs of the Earth's surface that grind past each other at a rate of up to 80mm per year.\nIn February 2010, a 8.8-magnitude struck off central Chile, killing more than 500 people.",

      "description": "Chile has evacuated one million residents along its coastline, following a powerful earthquake that caused buildings to sway in the South American country.\nThe quake, with a magnitude of 8.3, struck around 144 miles north-west of the capital Santiago.\nIt also triggered tsunami waves of up to 4.5 metres in some places.\nFive people have died and at least one person has been reported missing, officials say.\nThe tremor struck at 10.54pm (British time) on Wednesday night, the US Geological Survey said. Several strong aftershocks were reported just minutes later.\nAddressing the nation live on TV, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said she would travel to the affected areas later on Thursday.\nTsunami alerts were also issued for Peru, Hawaii, parts of California and as far away as New Zealand.\nChile is one of the most seismically active locations on the globe.\nIt runs along the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. These are massive slabs of the Earth's surface that grind past each other at a rate of up to 80mm per year.\nIn February 2010, a 8.8-magnitude struck off central Chile, killing more than 500 people.",

Several strong aftershocks were reported just minutes later.\nAddressing the nation live on TV, Chilean President Michelle Bachelet said she would travel to the affected areas later on Thursday.\nTsunami alerts were also issued for Peru, Hawaii, parts of California and as far away as New Zealand.\nChile is one of the most seismically active locations on the globe.\nIt runs along the boundary between the Nazca and South American tectonic plates. These are massive slabs of the Earth's surface that grind past each other at a rate of up to 80mm per year.\nIn February 2010, a 8.8-magnitude struck off central Chile, killing more than 500 people.",

      "description": "See more at http://ybca.org/work-progress\n\nEmerging from a desire to create a dynamic, nontraditional experiment in our galleries, Work in Progress: Investigations South of Market forefronts the process of art making and opens up a conversation about site, both within and beyond YBCA’s doors. Responding to a prompt from YBCA, six artists take a unique point of departure from which to explore the SOMA neighborhood. Inspirations include the events that have shaped the neighborhood including the 1906 earthquake and fire, which physically and psychologically transformed the landscape of San Francisco, the more recent changes that have come about since the opening of AT&T Park in 2000, and the environmental impacts of the building boom. Other projects look at the people who have inhabited the neighborhood over the years, from the Ohlone to the wealthy landowners of the 19th century to those who work and live here today.\n\nWork in Progress is an examination of place, artistic practice, and space. For the project, we invited a group of artists to submit proposals that address San Francisco’s South of Market neighborhood through research-based inquiry. The selected participants—Terry Berlier, Val Britton, Tom Loughlin, Jenny Odell, Stadium Projects (Joshua Peder Stulen, Monte Masi, and Lex Kosieradzki), and Weston Teruya—have been grouped into three sequential residencies, and the galleries are effectively becoming a working studio for them during their time at YBCA. As each residency rotates out, the works produced remain on site, with each residency building on the last and presenting a new layer of the cumulative experience.\n\nYBCA’s neighborhood has long been a locus of change, contention, and renewal. The newly commissioned works for this exhibition aim to deepen our understanding of, and connect back to, this rich history and legacy. Even as the artists investigate a specific locale within San Francisco, they also look beyond it, exploring broader themes of generosity, urban planning, environmental impact, and historical change.",

Similarly scatological humor, sexual humor, and race humor create comedy by violating social conventions or taboos in comic ways. A comedy of manners typically takes as its subject a particular part of society (usually upper class society) and uses humor to parody or satirize the behavior and mannerisms of its members. Romantic comedy is a popular genre that depicts burgeoning romance in humorous terms and focuses on the foibles of those who are falling in love.\nEntertainment is a form of activity that holds the attention and interest of an audience, or gives pleasure and delight.

      "description": "Visit our website to find the cost your neighbors have paid to replace their hot water heater.\nhttp://contractor.astriden.com/plumber/hot-water-heater-replacement-cost-santa-cruz.html\n\nWe posted on our website a survey that was done in 2015 and it gives a range of the typical cost people in your area have paid for the service.  You can also connect with plumbers on the website and get an estimate from a qualified, local plumber.  \nTips.\nTip #1 - Great plumbers have great reviews\nTip #2 - Hire a plumber that is licensed, bonded and insured.\nTip #3 - Make sure the plumbing service provides a warranty.\nWater heaters usually last around 10 years and leaking water heaters is an indicator you should replace the unit.  If the unit is not working, it may be cheaper to fix than to replace.  Common replacements include thermocouple, controller board replacement and pilot light replacement.  It will cost around $300 to one of these services done.  \nThe total price you pay will include parts, labor and permits.  The city may require a permit and you may have additional fees if you need modifications to be compliant with city code. Other costs may include haul away to remove the unit, earthquake straps to hold the unit in pace, and insulation around the pipes. \nQuestions to ask the plumber. What is the total cost or replacement including taxes and removal of the old unit? How long will it take to complete the project and when can it be done.  Is your company licensed, bonded and insured? Do you offer a warranty?  What brand of parts will be used and what warranty is offered by the manufacturer? \nPlumbers are usually available in the evening or weekends to deal with emergencies.  \nService Areas: Capitola, Santa Cruz, Scotts Valley, Watsonville, Aptos, Boulder Creek, Davenport, La Selva Beach, Live Oak, Soquel.\n\nRelated Videos.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AYLnbsrzD0o\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLl6lO_CBWyZlZEb_Pt8EHmw2Uy8b0_39F\nhttps://vimeo.com/147199823\n\nPlease subscribe to our channel.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UC7ptj6odh_fB9HybkGJXq_A\nMake sure to like this video and add your comments below.\nVisit our website.\nhttp://contractor.astriden.com/plumber/hot-water-heater-replacement-cost-santa-cruz.html",

      "description": "#darkscreensmatter\n\n#screensgodark \n\n\nA San Francisco man accused of burglarizing an apartment last May was acquitted earlier this week after his attorneys successfully argued that the suspect was actually attempting to board a spaceship he thought was on its roof.\nPublic defender Jeff Adachi told the court that Santonio Aviles, 41, was suffering meth-induced psychosis and believed the end of the world was nigh, CBS San Francisco reports.\nAviles somehow convinced a resident of the building to let him into the complex. Once inside, he climbed onto the fire escape and found an open window that he used to enter an apartment and take a short nap.\nWhen Aviles awoke, he threw an inflatable exercise ball onto the fire escape figuring he could use it as transportation into the next galaxy. He also stole a backpack from the apartment and loaded it with a passport and earthquake kit, SFGate.com reports.\nThe passport wasn't Aviles'. It belonged to a woman who, like him, had long dark hair. Aviles testified that he believed the passport would ensure his seat on the spaceship, according to a release by the San Francisco Public Defender's Office.\nAt some point while Aviles was getting ready to leave Earth forever, the apartment resident and his girlfriend woke up to see a strange man in their home.\nThe resident tackled Aviles and began punching while the woman hit the suspect with a baseball bat. Then the pair called 911.\nAviles suffered a black eye and various bruises, scratches and scrapes, according to the release. The man who lived in the apartment suffered an injured toe and developed a rash from the encounter.\nDuring the trial, public defender Jacque Wilson argued that Aviles did not enter the building to rob or hurt anyone, but was suffering a meth-induced mental health crisis, according to SFist.com.\n\nPlease donate to my paypal account so I can continue to bring you news of the day & the paranormal at :\n\nhttp://theguyfrompittsburgh.boardhost.com/\n\nPlease look at our crowdfunding page at :\n\nhttps://mobile.twitter.com/openlinesgerry",

      "description": "A strong storm system ushers in unsettled, stormy weather to California, including us here in San Jose/Milpitas, CA!  Strong winds, heavy rain, thunder, lightning and hail were all observed on this day alone.  Talk about El Niño finally settling in!\n\nWeather summary and scenario:\nAfter being battered with rain and strong winds the prior week, the Bay Area was again hit with yet another storm system, which arrived Sunday, December 13, 2015.  This system came on the heels of a storm that already had struck the region with rain, lightning, strong winds and hail.  This next storm had delivered a similar scenario to the San Francisco Bay Area... Additionally, wind advisories were issued for the Bay Area due to wind gusts possibly reaching 40-50 mph.  Power outages were also possible during the period.  By the way, a very brief power outage actually had taken place during our Sunday morning worship!  That was when the strong cold front from this system was passing thru with gusty winds and rains...\n\nSpeaking of the weather, our weather here in San Jose, CA was as follows:  A frontal system had moved thru.  The front was preceded by strong southerly winds accompanying heavy rainfall during the a.m. hours.  Spotty t-storms have later occurred in the afternoon due to an unstable airmass behind the passing strong cold front of this system.  One decent storm cell had went directly over us while we were stuck in traffic, on the way to Great Mall in Milpitas, CA!  That was intense indeed!  Windswept heavy rain, hail, thunder and lightning were all observed.  Surely, this 3rd winter-like storm in a week had brought more beneficial rain and snow to much of NorCal.  Rainfall amounts were to range from 1-2 inches across the North Bay with generally 1/2-1 inch around the rest of the San Francisco Bay Area.  For the remainder of the area... a half inch or less was forecast.  Also, a strong El Niño could still drench California in the upcoming winter months.  Keep those umbrellas handy!",

      "description": "Clash of Clans best Attack Strategy:\n\nRead more? Hit Show more!\n\nAbout Troops:\n\nBarbarians: Popularly known by serious players as \"Barbs\", they require the shortest training time of any troops (20 seconds). They travel at normal speed (16 units) and have moderate health and damage. Cannot attack airborne troops.\n\nArchers: The first units that can attack air troops, they are relatively fast to create (25 seconds). Ranged attack troops that fire arrows at their targets, they are faster than Barbarians (1.5x), but have less health (comparing maximum-level troops, the lowest of all troops) and do slightly less damage per second.\n\nGiants: Large (5 housing spaces) and slow troops (0.75x Barbarian speed) with robust health used mainly as \"meat shields\" for more fragile troops. Giants will attack defensive buildings until all of them are destroyed, and can only attack on the ground.\nWall Breakers: Skeletons that carry bombs, they require 2 housing spaces, travel at the same speed as Archers, attack only ground targets, and preferably target walls that guard buildings and their AI is trained such that they will only attack buildings surrounded completely by wall with no gaps for troops to enter. However this has been very controversial sparking debates on the Supercell Forums. \n\nWallbreakers take 2 minutes to train. Once they reach a wall (or, if no walls are available, a building or enemy troop), they halt for 1 second and detonate, blowing themselves up and doing damage to the target (plus splash damage). They have fragile health similar to that of Archers, and only modestly damage buildings or troops, but their damage is multiplied by 40 against walls.\n\nSpells:\n\nSpells play an essential role in offense. They are made in the spell factory. Currently, Clash of Clans features 5 spells which are created using elixir. They are:\n\nLightning Spell - The Lightning Spell is the first spell unlocked in the Spell Factory, and is automatically unlocked once the Spell Factory has finished construction. When this spell is used, a number of lightning bolts drop from the sky, damaging all but resource Buildings and enemy Troops randomly within a circle 7 tiles wide. The only spot that receives the full damage of the spell is the one-tile area onto which it was targeted. As of the July 1, 2015 update, the lightning spell won't affect storages. The lightning spell has six levels, each one with a higher amount of damage.\n\nGems:\n\nAside from gold and elixir, the game also uses gems as a currency. Gems are awarded for reaching certain milestones, completing achievements. One to six gems can be earned from clearing and obstacle such as a tree or a mushroom from your base though the algorithm for this is highly random. However, the main way to acquire gems is through in-app purchases using real world money. Gems can be used to \"boost\" building and heroes. Usually for a small sum 10 to 20 gems a player can boost and thus speed up their building to give a times faster output for roughly two hours. Barracks and spell factories are commonly boosted on higher levels of play",

The aquarium had a mini-tsunami and overflowed. We were in the kitchen and got tossed into the counter,\" wrote one commenter on the CBC website.\n\nMany reported feeling a large impact that felt like a truck hitting their homes, while others in Metro Vancouver reported windows rattling and items on walls shaking.\n\n\"I'm about 6 km from the epicentre and it felt like a truck had crashed into my house,\" wrote another commenter.\n\n\"I felt it in the West End here of Vancouver and I looked out my window to see if a truck had hit the side of my building! It was quite a sharp jolt that made my walls bend and creak, but nothing really shook or swayed,\" wrote another.",

There were no immediate reports of damage or injuries.\n\nA 7.7-magnitude earthquake with its epicentre in Afghanistan’s Hindu Kush region rocked the Indian capital and several other cities on Monday afternoon, sending people rushing out of homes and office buildings.\nThe tremors, which lasted several minutes, were also felt in areas around Delhi, parts of Jammu and Kashmir and as far afield as Kabul, Islamabad and Lahore.\nThe US Geological Survey (USGS) put the magnitude of the quake at 7.7, almost the same as the massive temblor that hit Nepal in April and killed nearly 10,000 people.\n\nIn most parts of Delhi, people rushed out of high-rise buildings in panic as the tremors continued for several minutes. There were no immediate reports of casualties or damage to property in the national capital though people tweeted photos of buildings in Gurgaon that developed cracks.\nThe quake in northeastern Afghanistan was 196 km deep and had its epicentre in a remote area of the Hindu Kush mountain range located 256 km from Kabul.\nBuildings were evacuated in Delhi and several other areas of northern India. The services of the Delhi Metro were suspended following the quake that struck at about 2.40pm.",

      "description": "Narendra Modi became the first Indian prime minister in more than a decade to visit Pakistan when he made a surprise stop in Lahore on Friday to meet his Pakistani counterpart, Nawaz Sharif, on his birthday\nIt started with a private phone call by the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi, to Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif of Pakistan on Friday morning to wish him a happy birthday.\n\nAbout four hours later, Mr. Modi landed in the Pakistani city of Lahore for an impromptu visit with Mr. Sharif, giving such little notice that Mr. Sharif’s national security adviser could not make the journey from Islamabad in time.\n\nIt was the first visit to Pakistan by an Indian premier in almost 12 years. The tense relations between India and Pakistan, both nuclear-armed nations, have long worried American policy makers, who fear that proxy wars between the two countries could flare into a real one. Mr. Modi is also highlighting India’s role in Afghanistan, including providing military assistance, which risks angering Pakistani leaders.\n\nContinue reading the main story\nRELATED COVERAGE\n\nPakistan Cancels Talks With India, Citing RestrictionsAUG. 22, 2015\nModi Rebukes Pakistan After Cancellation of TalksAUG. 29, 2014\nNarendra Modi, the Indian prime minister-elect who was the chief minister of Gujarat State, addressed a special farewell session of the state Legislative Assembly in Gandhinagar on Wednesday.Before Taking Office in India, Modi Sends an Invitation to PakistanMAY 21, 2014\nBut with his flash of spontaneous personal diplomacy on Friday, Mr. Modi appeared to send a strong public message that the ambiguous course he has taken toward Pakistan has shifted to embrace engagement, not confrontation. It is a message that his administration has hinted at in recent weeks, seeking to sketch out a road map for talks with Pakistan",

      "description": "DRIM! GREECE\n \nWith Francisco and the children we dreamt of travelling in the mountains, of making discoveries, meeting people and taking pictures. This is our dream, our DRIM Project (“Decouvertes, Rencontres, Images, Montagnes).\nThe DRIM! Adventure began in Greece last automn. Follow us on our trip through this travel diary. \n\nProduction: Sandra\nPhotographs: Sandra and Francisco\nVideos (production and editing): Francisco\nSponsors: Edelrid and Vaude.\n\nIntroduction\n \nLast year we discovered, with some professional climbers, climbing in Greece, at Météores, on the island of Kalymnos and at Leonido. Greece, a wonderful country, nowhere flat: a heaven for mountain lovers. Warm people, exquisite local specialities, and a great climate during the fall. We had to get back to Greece!\n \nThis year we decided to go to the Peloponnese, the southern part of continental Greece, but not just to climb. We wanted to discover the wonders that we only caught a glimpse of last year. We didn’t want to rush from one place to another, but instead to follow a small country road, then another, then a roadsign, an arrow, any direction that tempted us. In a nutshell, we wanted to wander the Peloponnese Mountains with only our van and a couple of spare weeks. So we bought a return  ticket for the ferry between Ancône, in Italy, and Patras in Greece. Our trip had begun!\n \nEPISODE 1.\nChestnuts and Climbing\n \nFor a couple of days we left the Peloponnese behind us and headed to Kalymnos, a Greek island off the Turkish coast. On our way back, we stopped near Athens, at Fili. We camped on the upper part of the city, next to the cliff. Early in the morning, we took time to enjoy a great site for novice climbers : no approach on foot, easy routes and even a bench at the bottom.  \n \nFrom here we went to the heart of the Peloponnese, in Arcadia. Then, one evening sitting around the campfire at the Loussios gorge : “Anna, can you imagine that the other children are already in bed because tomorrow they will have to go to school ?”. She smiles back at me, and I continue : “And we, we are eating chestnuts next to a campfire and a river, in Greece”. She smiles again… But the rains interrupts us. We rush to gather our things and get back to the van to avoid getting soaked, and especially to finish off the chestnuts.\n\nSome informations:\n● Filí (climbing site). Coordinates: 38.103597, 23.668803. About 20 kilometres from Athena. Near the Mount Parnitha, the highest on the peninsula of Attica.\n● Loussios gorge. Coordinates: 37.514350, 22.032700. Between the villages of Dimitsana and Stemnitsa, in Arcadia.\n● Corinth. Coordinates: 37.895149, 22.870287. The fortress is being on a steep of a rocky hill 575 meters high at its highest peak.\n\nMusic:\n* SLAM_30_64_De_Angi_Mejaro_Tidy_262252 Tribal Club SLAM030 SLAM!

      "description": "Within less than 48 hrs following the Mw 6.4 earthquake that occurred near Lefkada island in Greece, on November 17th 2015, engineers from Geoengineer.org, the University of Michigan (USA) and the University of Patras (Greece) mobilized to quickly perform condition assessment at select sites that are of potential scientific interest. The team deployed an Unmanned Aerial Autonomous Vehicle (UAAV) that was able to collect footage of affected areas. The UAAV successfully by-passed roads that were closed by landslides and other damaged infrastructure that impacted accessibility. This unprocessed video is launched immediately following UAAV deployment to make available data and footage that may prove valuable to first responders, engineers, rescue operators and damage assessors. It includes footage from the port of Vasiliki, the village of Ponti, and the famous beach of Egkremni that was devastated by landslides.\n\nVideo sections:\n\nport of Vasiliki (@0:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ\ntown of Vasiliki (@7:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=418\nDamaged pier in Vasiliki port (@12:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=724\nPonti village rock fall (@16:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=962\nLandsliding in Egremni beach (@24:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=1441\n\nFor more information contact Prof. Dimitrios Zekkos, University of Michigan at  http://www.dimitrioszekkos.org or Prof. George Athanasopoulos, University of Patras at : http://www.civil.upatras.gr/en/Proswpiko/faculty/entry/AthanasopoulosGeorge/?PageNo=0",

      "title": "Afteli Beach | Lefkada's Best Beaches",
      "description": "Afteli Beach Lefkada on map: https://www.google.ro/maps/place/Afteli/@38.6958506,20.5510549,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x135db77bac2118bd:0x68a17aed1c9d20e?hl=en\n\nLefkada has many beautiful beaches that you could explore. It makes no sense to visit Lefkada and just go to the beach near to your accomodation. Try to go to as many beaches as you can, Afteli Beach could be one of them. It's a special place that I love, that's why I made this video with pictures and my personal opinion about it. \n\nAfteli Beach is one of my favourites is Lefkada. It’s a small quiet bay, with clear tourqouise water, away from big crowds, a place that is a good holiday starting point for me. \n\nAfteli Beach is located in the South of Lefkada. From Vasiliki, the windsurfer’s spot it is 10 km away, that is around 18 minutes by car, from Nidri, the largest touristic region of Lefkada it is 18 km away, meaning a half an hour ride and from Lefkada City, the capital, you are 34 km away, that is around a 45 minute ride by car. From the main road to Afteli Bay you have 4 km of road to ride, so it’s best if you have a car, scooter or ATV. I don’t recommend walking. The road is pretty good, maybe except a small portion which is through Evgiros Village, it’s a bit tight here. As you descent to the beach the road is a little steepier and curvy. \n\nThe area feels like a botanical garden, being surrounded by trees which gives you that cosy feeling of being surrounded by nature. Usually, there are few people here, just enough so you don’t feel lonely and less to make you feel claustrophobic. The guys who take care of Afteli Beach live here in this house and also own a bar and a restaurant, where you can drink beers and grab a meal. The olive trees on the beach are beautiful to watch and they offer you the privilege of a fresh piece of natural shade. \n\nAfteli Beach is covered with pebbles, so don’t forget to take your beach shoes with you.\n\nGetting closer, you can almost feel the calm and cool state of just being here. No rules other than common sense. Everybody is enjoying their piece of scenery. It’s just my personal opinion that it’s best not to come in big groups here, the place is too small and serene for larger numbers of people. It’s ideal for couples, groups of 4 to 6 people or even families with small children because you can keep an eye on them all the time and the water is protected by the sea currents, so there aren't any big waves. \n\nA little tip: I suggest you go there in the first part of the day. The closer you get to the sunset time the shadier the bay gets. \nThey can give you free umbrellas if you need any, but don’t expect to find sun beds here. There are just a few of them. Instead you can bring your towels, or beach chairs and place them wherever you want, nobody will ask you for money just for sitting here. \n\nYou have a free shower which is fun to use. Showers on the beach are useful in Lefkada, because the water is pretty salty and it sticks to your skin after you bathe. \n\nYou will find the owner’s fishing boats here which are part of the whole landscape. If I was to go there and these boats were gone I would feel that something was missing. \n\nYou shouldn't worry about parking places. There are plenty. We could always find a spot. The owners did a pretty good job in this respect. They even painted the stone, so that you will park only on one spot to make room for others to enjoy the place too. \n\nThen there’s the beach bar well equipped with everything you could need to drink. I also appreciate that they didn't use these type of traditional Greek chairs, which I personally hate … they are the most unconfortable chairs I’ve ever sat on. Instead, Afteli’s bar has nice outdoor bar furniture where you can relax as much as you want, drinking beers or coffees or whatever you wish. The prices at the bar are reasonable, it’s like everywhere else in Lefkada. There’s also some good music playing in sourdine. If you are keen on reading, taking your book or your kindle here will be a delight for you.\n\nI hope my video helps in empowering your travel experience in Lefkada!\n\nMusic:\nCold Funk - Funkorama by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100499\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

Included is a detailed analysis of one of the oldest mysteries in history itself, what really happened to King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae.  Re-reading the 2500 year old text of Herodotus, the  Father of History, has revealed some missing conclusions.\n\nPutting aside the myths and legends surrounding the 300 Spartans, this documentary takes a detailed look at The Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, leading to the last stand of the 300 Spartans, other Greeks and the Great Spartan King, Leonidas. The legend passed down is that Leonidas went to Thermopylae with a picked band of 300 Spartans to defend the narrow pass with units from other Greek cities. Then on the 3rd day of the battle, when he found out he was being surrounded, he sent most of his troops away and covered their retreat with a last stand because Spartans never retreated. \n\nUsing the original text of Herodotus, the only \"contemporary\" source, it examines the actions of Leonidas as commander of the Greek force of over 7000 men facing 150-200,000 Persians. Why they were there and what eventually led to the most famous last stand in history. Focusing on six key passages in the text, the real story gives a completely different picture than the legend we all know. Leonidas did not stay because Spartans never retreated, they had already retreated once in this war. He had plenty of time to retreat if he wanted to, but his actions on the last day point to something completely different. The documentary concludes that while the legend is fabulous, the real story is astonishing. Leonidas had plans for the last day, and they did not involve a suicidal last stand!\n\nExclusive global agent/representative: http://www.CelebrateGreece.com",

      "description": "I was heart strucked when I saw that one of my beloved beaches had colapsed... Egremni Beach in Lefkada will never be the same after the earthquake of a 6.5 magnitude that happened in Lefkada, on the 17th of November 2015. \n\nI was just about to continue my video series of the best beaches in Lefkada I recently started, when I saw this. Now … all I can do is pay a tribute to Egremni by remembering our wonderful experience, although it’s hard to transmit the feelings thay you get when you forget about it all and just surround your whole being in enjoying the present.  \n\nThe reviews on Tripadvisor recommend Egremni Beach as the no.1 attraction in Lefkada. Also it seems to have been voted no. 2 in the 2015 Travelers’ Choice Award on the Top 10 Beaches in Greece. It was one of the first beaches I saw, with this almost unreal dramatic blue color. That’s probably the reason why I instantly got tears in my eyes, just for having the chance to see this place in my lifetime. And after the tears of happiness were gone, the nature’s work of art put a big smile on my face, which I kept during the entire stay there. This kind of places bring that child inside back to life – it’s just pure unspoiled happiness.\n\nWe were lazy that day and we chose the easy way and got there with a boat trip from Vasiliki, so we missed the opportunity of going up and down on those 350 steps.\n\nI was amused on how small the people on the beach looked from our boat. The thing was huge. The rocks were indeed massive and impressive. I later found out that Egremni used to be one of the longest beaches on the island stretching for about 2.5 km. And also that because of it’s width of 20 – 50 m it was impossible to get crowded. Some wild campers used to set their tents here… Just imagining how their days passed by gives me shivers. \n\nI wish I had more footage and with better quality, but when I went there I didn't imagine I would share this with the world :) \n\nIn the end I just wanna say this …I love you … my dearest Egremni, I will remember you always!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hookedonsharing\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/hookedonsharing/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hooked-on-Sharing-618021041675636/?fref=ts\n\nMusic: \nAcoustic Guitar 1 by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://audionautix.com/\n\nCredits:\nArticle found on forbes.com by Trevor Nace http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2015/11/24/lefkada-earthquake-destroys-pristine-greek-beach-before-after/\nMihai Andrei Catan on Youtube in a video about Egremni: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqHzITwsqaI",

Anagnostou - www.chiosphotos.gr\n\nΕναέρια λήψη γέφυρας Ρίου-Αντιρρίου - Aerial view of Rio-Antirio bridge\nΠεριγραφή\nΗ Γέφυρα Ρίου-Αντιρρίου ή, επίσημα, Γέφυρα Χαρίλαος Τρικούπης είναι καλωδιωτή γέφυρα που ολοκληρώθηκε το 2004 μεταξύ του Ρίου (κοντά στην Πάτρα) και του Αντιρρίου, που συνδέει την Πελοπόννησο με τη δυτική ηπειρωτική Ελλάδα και προς τα πάνω με το υπόλοιπο της Ευρώπης. Κατασκευάστηκε από την Γαλλική εταιρεία Vinci. Το μήκος της γέφυρας που στηρίζεται σε τέσσερις πυλώνες, ανέρχεται στα 2.252 μέτρα, ενώ μαζί με τις προσβάσεις φτάνει γύρω στα 2.883 μέτρα. Η γέφυρα αναπτύχθηκε και ολοκληρώθηκε, παρά τις δυσμενείς περιβαλλοντικές συνθήκες, ενώ το μέγιστο βάθος θεμελίωσης φθάνει τα 65 μέτρα υπό την επιφάνεια της θάλασσας. Πρόκειται για μία καλωδιωτή γέφυρα, οι αντοχές της οποίας είναι εντυπωσιακές. Περιλαμβάνει και πεζόδρομο/ποδηλατόδρομο η χρήση των οποίων απαλλάσσεται πληρωμής διοδίων.\nDescription\nThe Rio-Antirio Bridge, officially the Charilaos Trikoupis Bridge after the statesman who first envisaged it, is one of the world's longest multi-span cable-stayed bridges and the longest of the fully suspended type. It crosses the Gulf of Corinth near Patras, linking the town of Rio on the Peloponnese peninsula to Antirrio on mainland Greece by road. \nThe 2,880 m (9,449 ft) long bridge (approximately 1.8 miles) dramatically improves access to and from the Peloponnese, which could previously be reached only by ferry or via the isthmus of Corinth in the east. Its width is 28 m (92 ft) - it has two vehicle lanes per direction, an emergency lane and a pedestrian walkway. Its five-span four-pylon cable-stayed portion of length 2,252 m (7,388 ft) is the world's second longest cable-stayed deck; only the deck of the Millau Viaduct in southern France is longer at 2,460 m (8,071 ft). However, as the latter is also supported by bearings at the pylons apart from cable stays, the Rio-Antirrio Bridge deck might be considered the longest cable-stayed \"suspended\" deck.\n\nMusic\nHeading West by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://audionautix.com/",

      "description": "DRIM! GREECE\n \nWith Francisco and the children we dreamt of travelling in the mountains, of making discoveries, meeting people and taking pictures. This is our dream, our DRIM Project (“Decouvertes, Rencontres, Images, Montagnes).\nThe DRIM! Adventure began in Greece last automn. Follow us on our trip through this travel diary. \n\nProduction: Sandra\nPhotographs: Sandra and Francisco\nVideos (production and editing): Francisco\nSponsors: Edelrid and Vaude.\n\nIntroduction\n \nLast year we discovered, with some professional climbers, climbing in Greece, at Météores, on the island of Kalymnos and at Leonido. Greece, a wonderful country, nowhere flat: a heaven for mountain lovers. Warm people, exquisite local specialities, and a great climate during the fall. We had to get back to Greece!\n \nThis year we decided to go to the Peloponnese, the southern part of continental Greece, but not just to climb. We wanted to discover the wonders that we only caught a glimpse of last year. We didn’t want to rush from one place to another, but instead to follow a small country road, then another, then a roadsign, an arrow, any direction that tempted us. In a nutshell, we wanted to wander the Peloponnese Mountains with only our van and a couple of spare weeks. So we bought a return  ticket for the ferry between Ancône, in Italy, and Patras in Greece. Our trip had begun!\n \nEPISODE 1.\nChestnuts and Climbing\n \nFor a couple of days we left the Peloponnese behind us and headed to Kalymnos, a Greek island off the Turkish coast. On our way back, we stopped near Athens, at Fili. We camped on the upper part of the city, next to the cliff. Early in the morning, we took time to enjoy a great site for novice climbers : no approach on foot, easy routes and even a bench at the bottom.  \n \nFrom here we went to the heart of the Peloponnese, in Arcadia. Then, one evening sitting around the campfire at the Loussios gorge : “Anna, can you imagine that the other children are already in bed because tomorrow they will have to go to school ?”. She smiles back at me, and I continue : “And we, we are eating chestnuts next to a campfire and a river, in Greece”. She smiles again… But the rains interrupts us. We rush to gather our things and get back to the van to avoid getting soaked, and especially to finish off the chestnuts.\n\nSome informations:\n● Filí (climbing site). Coordinates: 38.103597, 23.668803. About 20 kilometres from Athena. Near the Mount Parnitha, the highest on the peninsula of Attica.\n● Loussios gorge. Coordinates: 37.514350, 22.032700. Between the villages of Dimitsana and Stemnitsa, in Arcadia.\n● Corinth. Coordinates: 37.895149, 22.870287. The fortress is being on a steep of a rocky hill 575 meters high at its highest peak.\n\nMusic:\n* SLAM_30_64_De_Angi_Mejaro_Tidy_262252 Tribal Club SLAM030 SLAM!

      "description": "Within less than 48 hrs following the Mw 6.4 earthquake that occurred near Lefkada island in Greece, on November 17th 2015, engineers from Geoengineer.org, the University of Michigan (USA) and the University of Patras (Greece) mobilized to quickly perform condition assessment at select sites that are of potential scientific interest. The team deployed an Unmanned Aerial Autonomous Vehicle (UAAV) that was able to collect footage of affected areas. The UAAV successfully by-passed roads that were closed by landslides and other damaged infrastructure that impacted accessibility. This unprocessed video is launched immediately following UAAV deployment to make available data and footage that may prove valuable to first responders, engineers, rescue operators and damage assessors. It includes footage from the port of Vasiliki, the village of Ponti, and the famous beach of Egkremni that was devastated by landslides.\n\nVideo sections:\n\nport of Vasiliki (@0:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ\ntown of Vasiliki (@7:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=418\nDamaged pier in Vasiliki port (@12:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=724\nPonti village rock fall (@16:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=962\nLandsliding in Egremni beach (@24:00) https://youtu.be/CR4WYNc_vEQ?t=1441\n\nFor more information contact Prof. Dimitrios Zekkos, University of Michigan at  http://www.dimitrioszekkos.org or Prof. George Athanasopoulos, University of Patras at : http://www.civil.upatras.gr/en/Proswpiko/faculty/entry/AthanasopoulosGeorge/?PageNo=0",

      "description": "Afteli Beach Lefkada on map: https://www.google.ro/maps/place/Afteli/@38.6958506,20.5510549,11z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x135db77bac2118bd:0x68a17aed1c9d20e?hl=en\n\nLefkada has many beautiful beaches that you could explore. It makes no sense to visit Lefkada and just go to the beach near to your accomodation. Try to go to as many beaches as you can, Afteli Beach could be one of them. It's a special place that I love, that's why I made this video with pictures and my personal opinion about it. \n\nAfteli Beach is one of my favourites is Lefkada. It’s a small quiet bay, with clear tourqouise water, away from big crowds, a place that is a good holiday starting point for me. \n\nAfteli Beach is located in the South of Lefkada. From Vasiliki, the windsurfer’s spot it is 10 km away, that is around 18 minutes by car, from Nidri, the largest touristic region of Lefkada it is 18 km away, meaning a half an hour ride and from Lefkada City, the capital, you are 34 km away, that is around a 45 minute ride by car. From the main road to Afteli Bay you have 4 km of road to ride, so it’s best if you have a car, scooter or ATV. I don’t recommend walking. The road is pretty good, maybe except a small portion which is through Evgiros Village, it’s a bit tight here. As you descent to the beach the road is a little steepier and curvy. \n\nThe area feels like a botanical garden, being surrounded by trees which gives you that cosy feeling of being surrounded by nature. Usually, there are few people here, just enough so you don’t feel lonely and less to make you feel claustrophobic. The guys who take care of Afteli Beach live here in this house and also own a bar and a restaurant, where you can drink beers and grab a meal. The olive trees on the beach are beautiful to watch and they offer you the privilege of a fresh piece of natural shade. \n\nAfteli Beach is covered with pebbles, so don’t forget to take your beach shoes with you.\n\nGetting closer, you can almost feel the calm and cool state of just being here. No rules other than common sense. Everybody is enjoying their piece of scenery. It’s just my personal opinion that it’s best not to come in big groups here, the place is too small and serene for larger numbers of people. It’s ideal for couples, groups of 4 to 6 people or even families with small children because you can keep an eye on them all the time and the water is protected by the sea currents, so there aren't any big waves. \n\nA little tip: I suggest you go there in the first part of the day. The closer you get to the sunset time the shadier the bay gets. \nThey can give you free umbrellas if you need any, but don’t expect to find sun beds here. There are just a few of them. Instead you can bring your towels, or beach chairs and place them wherever you want, nobody will ask you for money just for sitting here. \n\nYou have a free shower which is fun to use. Showers on the beach are useful in Lefkada, because the water is pretty salty and it sticks to your skin after you bathe. \n\nYou will find the owner’s fishing boats here which are part of the whole landscape. If I was to go there and these boats were gone I would feel that something was missing. \n\nYou shouldn't worry about parking places. There are plenty. We could always find a spot. The owners did a pretty good job in this respect. They even painted the stone, so that you will park only on one spot to make room for others to enjoy the place too. \n\nThen there’s the beach bar well equipped with everything you could need to drink. I also appreciate that they didn't use these type of traditional Greek chairs, which I personally hate … they are the most unconfortable chairs I’ve ever sat on. Instead, Afteli’s bar has nice outdoor bar furniture where you can relax as much as you want, drinking beers or coffees or whatever you wish. The prices at the bar are reasonable, it’s like everywhere else in Lefkada. There’s also some good music playing in sourdine. If you are keen on reading, taking your book or your kindle here will be a delight for you.\n\nI hope my video helps in empowering your travel experience in Lefkada!\n\nMusic:\nCold Funk - Funkorama by Kevin MacLeod is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1100499\nArtist: http://incompetech.com/",

Re-reading the 2500 year old text of Herodotus, the  Father of History , has revealed some missing conclusions.\n\nWhat was the real mission of Leonidas and the 300 Spartans?\nWere they always on a suicide mission?\n\nPresented by Dr Michael Scott of Cambridge University, with contributions from nine other experts and four researchers and using the latest research, satellite positioning, and imagery, the series gives complete coverage of the story. Included is a detailed analysis of one of the oldest mysteries in history itself, what really happened to King Leonidas and his 300 Spartans at Thermopylae.  Re-reading the 2500 year old text of Herodotus, the  Father of History, has revealed some missing conclusions.\n\nPutting aside the myths and legends surrounding the 300 Spartans, this documentary takes a detailed look at The Battle of Thermopylae in 480 BC, leading to the last stand of the 300 Spartans, other Greeks and the Great Spartan King, Leonidas. The legend passed down is that Leonidas went to Thermopylae with a picked band of 300 Spartans to defend the narrow pass with units from other Greek cities. Then on the 3rd day of the battle, when he found out he was being surrounded, he sent most of his troops away and covered their retreat with a last stand because Spartans never retreated. \n\nUsing the original text of Herodotus, the only \"contemporary\" source, it examines the actions of Leonidas as commander of the Greek force of over 7000 men facing 150-200,000 Persians. Why they were there and what eventually led to the most famous last stand in history. Focusing on six key passages in the text, the real story gives a completely different picture than the legend we all know. Leonidas did not stay because Spartans never retreated, they had already retreated once in this war. He had plenty of time to retreat if he wanted to, but his actions on the last day point to something completely different. The documentary concludes that while the legend is fabulous, the real story is astonishing. Leonidas had plans for the last day, and they did not involve a suicidal last stand!\n\nExclusive global agent/representative: http://www.CelebrateGreece.com",

      "description": "I was heart strucked when I saw that one of my beloved beaches had colapsed... Egremni Beach in Lefkada will never be the same after the earthquake of a 6.5 magnitude that happened in Lefkada, on the 17th of November 2015. \n\nI was just about to continue my video series of the best beaches in Lefkada I recently started, when I saw this. Now … all I can do is pay a tribute to Egremni by remembering our wonderful experience, although it’s hard to transmit the feelings thay you get when you forget about it all and just surround your whole being in enjoying the present.  \n\nThe reviews on Tripadvisor recommend Egremni Beach as the no.1 attraction in Lefkada. Also it seems to have been voted no. 2 in the 2015 Travelers’ Choice Award on the Top 10 Beaches in Greece. It was one of the first beaches I saw, with this almost unreal dramatic blue color. That’s probably the reason why I instantly got tears in my eyes, just for having the chance to see this place in my lifetime. And after the tears of happiness were gone, the nature’s work of art put a big smile on my face, which I kept during the entire stay there. This kind of places bring that child inside back to life – it’s just pure unspoiled happiness.\n\nWe were lazy that day and we chose the easy way and got there with a boat trip from Vasiliki, so we missed the opportunity of going up and down on those 350 steps.\n\nI was amused on how small the people on the beach looked from our boat. The thing was huge. The rocks were indeed massive and impressive. I later found out that Egremni used to be one of the longest beaches on the island stretching for about 2.5 km. And also that because of it’s width of 20 – 50 m it was impossible to get crowded. Some wild campers used to set their tents here… Just imagining how their days passed by gives me shivers. \n\nI wish I had more footage and with better quality, but when I went there I didn't imagine I would share this with the world :) \n\nIn the end I just wanna say this …I love you … my dearest Egremni, I will remember you always!\n\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/hookedonsharing\nPinterest: https://www.pinterest.com/hookedonsharing/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/Hooked-on-Sharing-618021041675636/?fref=ts\n\nMusic: \nAcoustic Guitar 1 by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://audionautix.com/\n\nCredits:\nArticle found on forbes.com by Trevor Nace http://www.forbes.com/sites/trevornace/2015/11/24/lefkada-earthquake-destroys-pristine-greek-beach-before-after/\nMihai Andrei Catan on Youtube in a video about Egremni: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GqHzITwsqaI",

I hope this snippet gives you a taste and evokes passion & inspires your love for Greece, the fascination of its culture & lifestyle, and its welcoming & outgoing people. It is a magnificent paradise. A place I call heaven on earth!  \n\nThe music I’ve included in my video clip is by an amazing and talented group of Modern Greek artists with an international presence. Vasilis Sagonas has done an incredible job of remixing and producing this piece. All credit should be directed to them. I love this club mix: Playmen feat Demy -“Fallin” (V-Sag Remix) as it synergistically compliments the video clip very well. \n\nMusic written by Playmen, New Tone (R. Prini. R. Remondina, P. Sandrini), Stan, Remixed by V-Sag\nProduced, Mixed, Arranged & Mastered by Vasilis Sagonas at DSS.

Anagnostou - www.chiosphotos.gr\n\nΕναέρια λήψη γέφυρας Ρίου-Αντιρρίου - Aerial view of Rio-Antirio bridge\nΠεριγραφή\nΗ Γέφυρα Ρίου-Αντιρρίου ή, επίσημα, Γέφυρα Χαρίλαος Τρικούπης είναι καλωδιωτή γέφυρα που ολοκληρώθηκε το 2004 μεταξύ του Ρίου (κοντά στην Πάτρα) και του Αντιρρίου, που συνδέει την Πελοπόννησο με τη δυτική ηπειρωτική Ελλάδα και προς τα πάνω με το υπόλοιπο της Ευρώπης. Κατασκευάστηκε από την Γαλλική εταιρεία Vinci. Το μήκος της γέφυρας που στηρίζεται σε τέσσερις πυλώνες, ανέρχεται στα 2.252 μέτρα, ενώ μαζί με τις προσβάσεις φτάνει γύρω στα 2.883 μέτρα. Η γέφυρα αναπτύχθηκε και ολοκληρώθηκε, παρά τις δυσμενείς περιβαλλοντικές συνθήκες, ενώ το μέγιστο βάθος θεμελίωσης φθάνει τα 65 μέτρα υπό την επιφάνεια της θάλασσας. Πρόκειται για μία καλωδιωτή γέφυρα, οι αντοχές της οποίας είναι εντυπωσιακές. Περιλαμβάνει και πεζόδρομο/ποδηλατόδρομο η χρήση των οποίων απαλλάσσεται πληρωμής διοδίων.\nDescription\nThe Rio-Antirio Bridge, officially the Charilaos Trikoupis Bridge after the statesman who first envisaged it, is one of the world's longest multi-span cable-stayed bridges and the longest of the fully suspended type. It crosses the Gulf of Corinth near Patras, linking the town of Rio on the Peloponnese peninsula to Antirrio on mainland Greece by road. \nThe 2,880 m (9,449 ft) long bridge (approximately 1.8 miles) dramatically improves access to and from the Peloponnese, which could previously be reached only by ferry or via the isthmus of Corinth in the east. Its width is 28 m (92 ft) - it has two vehicle lanes per direction, an emergency lane and a pedestrian walkway. Its five-span four-pylon cable-stayed portion of length 2,252 m (7,388 ft) is the world's second longest cable-stayed deck; only the deck of the Millau Viaduct in southern France is longer at 2,460 m (8,071 ft). However, as the latter is also supported by bearings at the pylons apart from cable stays, the Rio-Antirrio Bridge deck might be considered the longest cable-stayed \"suspended\" deck.\n\nMusic\nHeading West by Audionautix is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nArtist: http://audionautix.com/",

You are full of all kinds of deceit and trickery. Will you never stop perverting the right ways of the Lord? 11 Now the hand of the Lord is against you.

Pastor Marco Quintana of Community Church of Devore, summarizes world issues and events for 2015 and how the fulfillment of Bible prophecy becomes clearer and the 2nd coming of Jesus Christ becomes closer. With the collapse of morality, the refugee crisis around the world and the world financial crisis coupled with the rapid rise in technology, prophecy concerning the coming anti-christ and the number of the beast 666 is more evident each day. Are we approaching the time of Jacob's trouble as prophesied in the bible? It appears so.",
