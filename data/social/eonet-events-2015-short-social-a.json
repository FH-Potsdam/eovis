Photographer taking photo\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nPakistani troops and rescue workers continued their struggle on Sunday, to help 1.3 (m) million victims of monsoon-triggered floods in the country's southwest.\r\nOn Sunday 265 people arrived in Karachi aboard the PNS Tariq, a ship of the Pakistani navy.\r\nA Pakistani navy official said that the people had been been rescued from Ormara and other coastal areas of Baluchistan.\r\n\"They were stranded there and they were in need obviously to be lifted and taken out of that area so we have brought them to here in Karachi and we have despatched them to their respective houses,\" Captain Mazhar said.\r\nZulfiqar Ali, a flood survivor said he and others were trapped on the Angora bridge.\r\n\"We were stranded there for two days.  Then the navy was informed, which brought us to Ormara.  They really helped us and finally brought us to Karachi,\" Ali said.\r\nEarlier 122 people including women, children and elders, were brought to Karachi.\r\nThe floods have left as many as 100 people dead in southwestern Pakistan, a senior relief official said on Sunday, as the government appealed for donations of tents to shelter about one million people left homeless by the flooding.\r\nThe deaths have occurred in the southwestern province of Baluchistan since Tuesday, when Cyclone Yemyin and rains triggered floods across a vast area, said Tariq Ayub, Baluchistan's home secretary, who is overseeing the flood relief operation.\r\nAuthorities said many of the casualties occurred due to drowning and people getting trapped under the debris of their collapsing homes.\r\nWith roads washed away by the flood waters leaving hundreds of villages cut off by swollen rivers, army helicopters have been flying over the affected areas and dropping tents, food and clean water to stranded villagers.\r\nBut more heavy rains are expected in the normally arid areas around coastal town of Turbat, about 650 kilometres (400 miles) southeast of Quetta, leaving rescue workers in a race against time to get as much aid to victims as possible before they are cut off by floods once again. \r\nWorkers from local welfare group, the Edhi Foundation, have formed mobile kitchens and tour villages supplying the hot meals and clean water. \r\nVillagers elsewhere said they were still waiting for aid to arrive.\r\nOfficials have said a large number of people in Baluchistan's flood-hit area had no access to safe drinking water, raising the possibility of waterborne diseases. \r\nA Pakistani Navy spokesperson told reporters that rescue and relief operations were underway along the coastal belts of the Balochistan. \r\nHe said the PNS Kalimaat, carrying food aid, had reached Ormara and two medical camps were being set up in Gawadar and Pasni. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/98494ef009fca9b6e355be9ad6bddfb8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Aerial of crowd of homeless people from Nasirabad district\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nPakistan called on the international community to rush aid to some one (m) million people left homeless by massive flooding amid forecasts on Monday that still more rain would be dumped on the stricken areas in coming days.\r\nFloods due to a cyclone and rain since 23 June have left as many as 211 people dead in two provinces of southern Pakistan, a senior relief official said on Monday, but unofficial estimates are considerably higher.\r\nSome 500 people have died across the subcontinent, in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, since the start of the monsoon season in early June.\r\nFollowing a two-day tour of the flooded area on Sunday, Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz asked for relief and rehabilitation aid from foreign countries, international agencies and private donors.\r\nHe said more helicopters would be added to army efforts to ferry food, medicine and other relief supplies to areas of Baluchistan province which was hit by Cyclone Yemyin last Tuesday.\r\nIn Nasirabad, 50 kilometres (31 miles) west of Turbat, Baluchistan on Monday, aid was seen being loaded onto helicopters and dropped into the region. \r\n\"Today we are dropping our medical teams in different places like Nasirabad and Alumdar. In the mornings we drop the teams and in the afternoon we come and pick them up again and take them back to base. We are dropping relief goods like food stuffs, medicines, tents, mineral water, lots of it,\" said Major Shahid Saeed, a pilot from one of the helicopters delivering aid to the victims. \r\nThe military said Pakistani and Chinese engineers had reopened the Karakoram Highway, which runs between the two countries. \r\nThe road link was severed by heavy, rain-spawned landslides near the 4,733-metre (15,528-feet) Khunjrab Pass.\r\nIn the Baluchistan city of Turbat, one of the worst-affected areas, doctors reported an influx of patients, many of them children, suffering from nausea, diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases.\r\nThe flooding has also spread in recent days into adjacent Sindh province to the east, where some 200-thousand people were rendered homeless in Shahdad Kot district after waters from a canal spilled over protective embankments, provincial relief commissioner Munir Ahmed said on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d5da848e25fc7de5d4e4d8e67c8f7c34 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

At least a thousand crossed at Chaman, on the border between Afghanistan and the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan.\r\nMany came from the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar and said they were fleeing American bombs.\r\n\r\n0020 \"There was continuous bombardment,\" this man said, \"and it wasn't against the military bases - it was on civilian vehicles.

And if this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world. So they will threaten the people but their capacity and capability is now not that much. And whosoever, the aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security.\"\r\n7. Wide of news conference ending\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nPakistan's government vowed on Friday to protect foreign aid workers against attacks from the Taliban, who have issued a veiled threat against relief organisations helping out in the country's flooding crisis. \r\nThe comments came as hundreds of thousands of people fled floodwaters after the surging River Indus smashed through levees in two places, but many refused to leave the danger zone while others took shelter in an ancient graveyard for Muslim saints.\r\nThe Taliban threat is likely to complicate the massive relief effort, while more than 8 (m) million people are in need of emergency assistance across the country.\r\nThe United Nations, the Pakistani army and a host of other local and international relief groups have been rushing aid workers, medicine, food and water to the affected regions, but are unable to reach many people.\r\nThe Pakistani Taliban on Thursday hinted they might attack the foreign aid workers. The militant network has a history of attacking aid groups, including agencies under the UN umbrella.\r\nMilitant spokesman Azam Tariq said the US and other countries were not really focused on providing aid to flood victims but had other motives he did not specify.\r\nPakistan's information minister promised to protect those who are helping in flood relief efforts. \r\n\"The aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security,\" Qamar Zaman Kaira told reporters. \r\nHe said the Taliban are trying to use the crisis to their advantage. \r\n\"The Taliban are basically threatening the whole nation, the whole world,\" he said. \r\n\"If this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world.\" \r\nHowever, he added that the Taliban's \"capacity and capability\" had been weakened. \r\nThe United States - which has launched scores of missile attacks against militant targets in the far northwest over the last 2 1/2 years - hopes to improve its highly unpopular image in Pakistan through its aid efforts. It has deployed 19 civilian and army helicopters to ferry aid and victims.\r\n\"Our brothers and sisters who live there face this difficult situation,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b25c96209eedd444ef7bcd34b8fe3b16 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Many homes in the area were already submerged. \r\nAuthorities piled stones and sandbags to strengthen embankments protecting the city of Shadad Kot in Sindh from rising waters as the floods moved slowly south after leaving thousands of square kilometres (miles) of destruction in their wake.\r\nOn the eastern side of the city, the embankment was under pressure from nine-foot high waters, said Yaseen Shar, the top administrative official there.\r\nMost of the city's 350-thousand people have moved to relief camps or to towns and cities away from the danger.\r\nLocal charities, the Pakistani army and international agencies are providing food, water, medicine and shelter to the displaced, but (m) millions have received little or help. \r\nAid officials warn that waterborne diseases like cholera now posed a real threat.\r\nThe disaster has left around six (m) million people homeless from the mountainous north to the plains in the south, where the floods are expected to drain into the Arabian Ocean in the coming days and weeks.\r\nThe shaky government has come under criticism for its response, and will require (b) billions of dollars in foreign aid to rebuild.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b52148af56199626fb01f0464d5a1d3e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

I am living in misery,\" said one flood victim. \r\nIn southern Pakistan, the river Indus is now more than 15 miles (25 kilometres) wide at some points - 25 times wider than during normal monsoon seasons.\r\nMany flood victims are living in muddy camps or overcrowded government buildings, while thousands more are sleeping in the open next to their cows, goats and whatever possessions they managed to drag with them. \r\nThe UN has appealed for 460 (m) million US dollars to help Pakistan get immediate relief, but officials have said the country will need (b) billions to rebuild after the waters recede.\r\nPakistan was already struggling to battle a violent Islamist militant movement on its soil, and its offensives were considered important to the US goals in the war in neighbouring Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5a1bcdbe7a5149c1b1651c7c9246d756 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of journalists\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nPakistan toned down its Independence Day celebrations on Saturday amid a flooding disaster that has displaced (m) millions of its citizens.\r\nOfficials cancelled the colourful, fireworks ceremony normally held at midnight on August 14, the anniversary of Pakistan's creation and independence from Britain in 1947. \r\nBut smaller events still went ahead, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum in Karachi, where Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah is buried.\r\nSindh Province Governor Ishrat Ul Ibad Khan and Chief Minister Qaim Ali Shah laid wreaths on the grave, accompanied by a guard of honour. \r\nSindh Province has been hit hard by the flooding. Fresh flood water swelled the River Indus on Saturday, threatening more cities, towns and villages in the province.\r\nIn a televised address to the nation Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said 20 (m) million were now homeless. \r\nHe did not elaborate, and it was unclear how many of those people were briefly forced to leave their homes and how many had lost their houses altogether.\r\nGilani also participated in a flag-raising ceremony on Saturday morning. \r\nThe floods have disrupted the lives of at least 14 (m) million people - 8 percent of the population. \r\nTriggered by unusually heavy monsoon rains, the floods have swept south through the country.\r\nIn southern Pakistan, the River Indus is now more than 15 miles (25 kilometres) wide at some points - 25 times wider than during normal monsoon seasons.\r\nThe UN said on Saturday that a case of cholera has been confirmed in Pakistan's northwest and aid workers expect it is not isolated.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bea0245ea582827fb2ae8d954d13e192 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Close-up of flood victims standing and laying beside rail track \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nMore rain soaked flood-ravaged Pakistan on Saturday and even heavier downpours were forecast for coming days, deepening a crisis which Pakistani officials estimate as affected as many as 13 million (m) people throughout the South Asian nation.\r\nAbout 1,500 people have died, most of them in the northwest, the hardest-hit region. \r\nMass evacuations are under way in the southern province of Sindh after the Indus River rose there.\r\nThe intense flooding that began about two weeks ago has washed away roads, bridges and many communications lines, hampering rescue efforts. \r\nIncessant monsoon rains have grounded many helicopters trying to rescue people and ferry aid, including six choppers manned by US troops on loan from Afghanistan.\r\nFloodwaters receded somewhat on Friday in the northwest, but downpours in the evening and early Saturday again swelled rivers and streams. \r\nPakistani meteorologists said heavy rains in Afghanistan were expected to make things even worse over the next 36 hours as the bloated Kabul River surged into Pakistan's northwest.\r\nThat will likely mean more woes for Punjab and Sindh provinces as well, as new river torrents flow east and south.\r\nIn the northwest and Punjab, floods have displaced 12 million (m) people, said an official with the National Disaster Management Authority. \r\nIn the Punjab city of Kot Addu, flood victim Ghulam Hafeeza walked through floodwaters with her three children, one of them sick, trying to make it to a hospital almost 90 kilometres (60 miles) from where she was. \r\n\"My son has been suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea since yesterday. Last night I took him to the hospital and he was injected with (IV) drips all night. I spent the whole night in hospital,\" she explained through tears. \r\nThe hospital she took her son to, the Government Civil Hospital of Kot Addu, has also been badly affected by the floods so a doctor advised her to travel the long distance to the Muzaffarghar hospital to get care for her sick child.\r\n\"How I can go? Nobody is with me, floodwater is everywhere. I don't have money. My house and everything was swept away. I have two sons and one daughter. I am carrying my children and finding my way,\" a desperate Hafeeza said as she continued her journey. \r\nNearby, some attempted to cross raging floodwaters using ropes while others carried their belongings through knee deep water. \r\nIn Sindh province, about 1 million (m) people have been evacuated or are being helped out of their homes, said the provincial irrigation minister.\r\nAuthorities have given varying tolls for the number of people among Pakistan's 175 million (m) impacted by the floods.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/43e5d4e5c9d12d609306e27bbc059587 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of ceremony\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe Pakistani army used boats and helicopters to move stranded villagers in the country's eastern Punjab province to higher ground as many parts of the region remained submerged in flood water.\r\nAn aerial view from a military helicopter showed a vast area around the districts of Kot Addu and Jhelum almost entirely underwater, with only rooftops sticking out from beneath the surface.\r\nThe province's relief commissioner said on Thursday that 1,261 villages had been affected by the floods, with around 1.5 (m) million people rendered homeless.\r\n\"So far, flood related deaths in Punjab province are around 15,\" Ikhlaq Tarar said.\r\nThe region's army commander said many people had ignored flood warnings and only realised the danger of the situation when water had already entered their cities, towns and villages.\r\nIn the country's south, meanwhile, authorities began evacuating half-a-million people as the worst monsoon rains in decades threatened new destruction.\r\nIn the northwest, the US army have joined international aid agencies, airlifting hundreds of stranded people and distributing emergency food.\r\nThe floods have already killed an estimated 1,500 people over the past week, most in the northwest.\r\nThe Pakistani government response to the floods has been criticized, especially because President Asif Ali Zardari left for a visit to Europe soon after the crisis began.\r\nAs fresh rains fell on Thursday, bloated rivers gushed toward southern Sindh province, where hundreds of thousands of the most impoverished Pakistanis live along the water because of fertile soil.\r\nMany flood victims have also complained that aid is not reaching them fast enough or at all.\r\nPakistani Prime Minister, Yusuf Raza Gilani, said on Thursday that evacuations had been the biggest issue for the government.\r\n\"The big issue was evacuating these people.  We are evacuating them and, afterwards, providing them with relief. To provide them with tents, food, protection, shelter and medicines,\" he said, speaking in Islamabad.\r\nGilani added that the government is starting to assess the damage with the help of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\r\n\"When all the assessment is completed, certainly we will compensate these people who were martyred (killed) and were swept away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/466b72dc66d1bdbab030432710dba8fd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

While I was trying to flee, a child of mine was slipped away from my hands and was swept away by the gushing water,\" BiBi Shehnaz said.\r\n\"I do not know his whereabouts yet,\" she said, recounting a tale that has become all too familiar in the region. \r\nThe fresh rains in the hardest-hit northwest threatened to overwhelm a major dam and unleash a new deluge.\r\nRelief work for some 3.2 million people has been delayed by swamped roads, washed-out bridges and downed communication lines, and survivors have complained about government inaction. \r\n\"Government hasn't done enough for us, I will appeal to the government at least to help the children,\" said one villager Tuesday. \r\nThe loss of so many crops was one reason the UN's World Food Program estimated that some 1.8 (m) million Pakistanis would need food assistance for at least the next month.\r\nAside from farmers, many victims have small businesses that have been destroyed and won't have the means to buy food for their families, a WFP\r\n(World Food Programme) spokeswoman said in Geneva.\r\nThe northwest is the epicentre of Pakistan's battle against al-Qaida and the Taliban. \r\nAlongside military and police operations, the government - with the support of the West - has tried to improve its services and living standards there to blunt the appeal of militancy.\r\nThe Pakistani army, which has the helicopters, boats and infrastructure needed for relief work, is delivering food, medicine and tents, as are government agencies and several different political parties and welfare organisations.\r\nBut many flood victims were unhappy with the response. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6f6f663488c1892cc317baa84d0235e4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of area under flood water\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nRescue workers struggled on Sunday to save more than 27,000 people still trapped by massive flooding in Pakistan's northwest that has killed over 900 people and destroyed thousands of homes, officials said.\r\nThe effort has been aided by a slackening of the monsoon rains that have caused the worst flooding in decades in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa province. \r\nBut as flood waters have started to recede, authorities have begun to understand the full scale of the disaster.\r\nIn Nowshera city - where water levels were dropping on Sunday - some people were slowly making their way back to their houses.\r\nShair Dad, a timber shop owner, said his business has been badly affected by the floods.\r\n\"I haven't covered my losses in ten years, we are buying this wood on credit, I don't know how I will be able pay it back,\" he said on Sunday.\r\nThe death toll from the flooding has risen to 903 people, said Mujahid Khan, the head of rescue services for the Edhi Foundation, a private charity.\r\nThe worst hit areas have been the districts of Swat and Shangla, where more than 400 people have died, he said.\r\nAuthorities have deployed 43 military helicopters and over 100 boats to try to rescue some 27,300 people still trapped by the floods.       \r\nThe military has deployed 30,000 army troops who had evacuated 19,000 trapped people by Saturday night, said an army spokesman. \r\nBut the scale of the disaster has strained the resources of a government already grappling with a faltering economy and a brutal war against the Taliban.\r\nThe floods have caused an acute shortage of fruits and vegetables in the northwest because many of the hardest hit areas were the key centres of production, officials said.\r\nThe threat of disease loomed as well as some evacuees arrived in temporary camps with fever, diarrhea and skin problems.\r\nA variety of nations and aid organisations have begun to mobilise a response to the flood disaster.\r\nThe US delivered 380,000 food packages, four rescue boats and two water filtration units to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said a spokesman for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.\r\nThe US Embassy in Islamabad has also announced it will provide 12 prefabricated steel bridges to temporarily replace some of the spans damaged by the water.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, Pakistani officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7da343e1357b0bb25d7a3d9571210bcf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

This time we have some medicine and some medicine will come after some time.\"\r\n11. Civil defence member walking with box of medicine \r\n12. Emergency kit at civil defence camp\r\n13. Mid of flood water in Indus river\r\n14. Wide of flood water in Indus river \r\nSTORYLINE \r\nFlooding in Pakistan has killed more than 800 people in a week, a government official said on Saturday as rescuers struggled to reach marooned victims and some evacuees showed signs of fever, diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases.\r\nThe flooding caused by record-breaking rainfalls caused massive destruction in the past week, especially in the northwest province, where officials said it was the worst deluge since 1929. \r\nThe United Nations estimated on Saturday that some 1 (m) million people nationwide were affected by the disaster, though it didn't specify exactly what that meant.\r\nThe information minister for the northwest province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said reports coming in from various districts across the northwest showed that more than 800 people had died due to the flooding. Many people remain missing.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\nIn Dera Ismail Khan, a military helicopter landed with soldiers bearing relief supplies. \r\nBut Anwar Ullah Khan, a civil defence official, complained that they weren't receiving enough aid. \r\nHe said that there weren't any vehicles available to take injured people to hospital, nor have they received any money to help buy medicine. \r\nA doctor treating evacuees at a small relief camp in Nowshera in the northeast said some had diarrhoea and others had marks appearing on their skin, causing itching. \r\nChildren and the elderly seemed to have the most problems, Mehmood Jaa said.\r\nRescuers were using army helicopters, heavy trucks and boats to try reaching flood-hit areas, the UN said. It reported that thousands of homes and roads were destroyed, and at least 45 bridges across the northwest were damaged.\r\nThe destruction is slowing the rescue effort, said a government official in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, the northwest province.\r\nThe head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said that no more rain was expected in the next few days for the northwest and that floodwaters there were receding. \r\nBut Punjab province in the east, Sindh province in the south, and Pakistan's side of the disputed Kashmir region all could expect a lashing over the next three or four days, he said.\r\nFlooding has already affected some of those regions, with more than 21 people dying in Kashmir. A plane crash that killed 152 people in Islamabad on Wednesday also occurred during stormy weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5f93b4cb3f3fc17630357976069c8491 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of relief workers cooking food for displaced people\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThousands of Pakistani villagers were flushed from their homes in the southern Sindh province, as authorities and international aid groups struggled to respond to Pakistan''s second major bout of flooding in just over a year.\r\nResidents of Tando Bago, in the worst-hit district of Badin, about 200 kilometres from Karachi, were leaving their flooded houses with only the belongings they could carry with them.\r\nMonsoon rains since early August have killed more than 220 people, damaged or destroyed some 665-thousand homes and displaced more than 1.8 (m) million people in Sindh province, according to the government and the UN, which on Sunday made an emergency appeal for funding.\r\nDuring the past weeks, flood victims have been camping out on roadsides and dry fields, receiving aid from charities.\r\nAli Akbar, a displaced Pakistani living in a camp near Tando Bago said he and his family have been brought to a camp by a Pakistani aid group, the Al Khidmat Foundation, where they receive medical help and food.\r\nSindh saw similar scenes during last year''s floods, which at their peak affected all four of the country''s provinces and triggered a massive international aid response. \r\nWhile some districts in the region have been flooded out twice, many of the hardest-hit towns and villagers this year were unaffected in 2010.\r\nThe return of the floods is testament to the powerful penetration of the monsoon rains that envelop much of Asia at the end of summer. \r\nAs the rain did last year, the floods are undercutting the legitimacy of the shaky government, which is widely disliked and struggling against Islamist militants, political turmoil and massive economic problems.\r\nIn 2010, the floods followed the course of the River Indus and its tributaries from the foothills of the Himalayas to the flatlands of Sindh, where the river empties out into the Arabian Sea.\r\nMany of the countries that helped out then, including the US, have mobilised again this year to assist victims.\r\nThe US said it paid for food packages for 23-thousand families and its local partners will soon begin handing out tents, clean water and other supplies.\r\nJapan and China have also pledged relief goods or money, according to the Pakistan government.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8d3fb6821706218005905e74976d0bc8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of news conference\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe UN special envoy for assistance to Pakistan said on Thursday that more needs to be done to help those affected by last year's devastating floods.\r\nThe comments by Rauf Engin Soysal came as Pakistan marked the first anniversary of the country's worst ever floods that inundated a chunk of the country the size of the United Kingdom.\r\nThe flood that struck Pakistan in July 2010 represented one of the most devastating natural disaster of the decade, submerging almost one fifth of the country, killing 2000 people, affecting 20 (m) million and destroying 1.6 (m) million homes.   \r\nReconstruction is predicted to cost up to 10.9 (b) billion US dollars, almost one-quarter of Pakistan's national budget. \r\nIt is unclear how Pakistan will come up with the money, and some flood victims complain that corruption has prevented them from benefiting from funds that are available.\r\nZafar Iqbal Qadir, chairman of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, said that Pakistani government was willing to provide those who have been affected with \"proper housing\", however the government does not have the funds for their construction at this point.\r\nThe problem could get worse this year because Pakistan's threshold for coping with flooding is lower. \r\nMany of last year's victims are extremely vulnerable, and much of the flood infrastructure that was damaged, such as bunds and dikes, has not been repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8f4e96cd3bb027f28dd3a9531eda9447 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Distressed by growing extremism, lack of development and discriminatory policies of Islamabad, the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir want to be a part of India, claimed Moulana Syed Athar Hussain Dehlavi, the chairman of the Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool. Dehlavi, who visited PoK after the devastating floods last year, said people there favour a referendum so that they can vote to join back to India. In September last year, when Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the flood-affected areas of PoK, he was greeted with slogans “Go Nawaz Go”. It reflected the frustration of the people with regard to the apathy of the Pakistan government in dealing with the very critical situation. The people in PoK are fed up with the atrocities committed against them by the Pakistani establishment for decades. The region has always been neglected by Islamabad and used for nurturing terror camps. The people of PoK are shocked after Pakistan signed more than 50 pacts worth an estimated USD 46 billion in infrastructure projects as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The corridor passed through Kashmir, will connect the city of Kashgar in western China with the Pakistani deep sea port of Gwadar.",

Out of 11,000 registered since 1999, as many as 2,500 are in Antioquia.  The pilot project consists of six stages, the first of which was the selection of the initial regions, and it is being followed by the Identification of the characteristics of the region. The deactivation and removal will be carried out by a special battalion of the army, accompanied by FARC rebels, who will show the troops where the land mines are located.

I came from so far, like from Asia to here. I came here to work hard, not for resting. If  I wanted to rest, I can rest in my home, in my country, said Sergeant Abdul Najid Haldary.\r\nAfghanistan is currently struggling to control its drug trade, especially opium. \r\nAn estimated 93 percent of the world's opium comes from Afghanistan, bringing in as much as 2 (b) billion US dollars (1.5 (b) billion euro) a year in profits.\r\nExperts say booming profits from the lucrative crop are being used to fuel the Taliban. \r\nColombia, on the other hand, has a long history of battling drug cartels.\r\nThe country remains remains the source of more than 90 percent of the world's cocaine, despite the recent unprecedented aerial fumigation of coca crops across the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2011c8ba36a6bbcab62fa8908e11127d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Delegation entering morgue  \r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nTeams from France and from the island of Martinique continued their investigation in Venezuela on Thursday into the crash of a passenger jet that killed all 160 on board. \r\n\r\nThe jet was carrying 152 passengers home from Panama to Martinique, a French overseas department in the Caribbean, when it crashed on Tuesday in Venezuela. \r\n\r\nForensic experts and equipment used to identify victims'' bodies arrived from France at the University of Zulia medical school in the western Venezuelan city of Maracaibo, where the bodies are being held in a morgue. \r\n\r\nEight Colombian crew members were also killed in the crash.\r\n\r\nCol. Antonio Rivero, the chief of Venezuela''s emergency agency, said workers on Thursday were continuing to search for dead bodies and human remains at the crash site.\r\n\r\nColombia has grounded the airline that chartered the flight from Martinique while its civil air authority reviewed inspections that the small carrier had been required to perform.\r\n\r\nTeams of French experts travelled to Venezuela to aid in the investigation and help identify victims'' remains, officials said. \r\n\r\nA strong odour of decaying bodies permeated the air outside the medical school morgue in Maracaibo where the bodies were being identified.\r\n\r\nThree refrigerated shipping containers were placed outside for the remains to be loaded once identified.\r\n\r\nThree men and a woman arrived from Martinique at the morgue accompanied by the French consul and hurried inside without speaking to journalists who crowded around them. They were said to be representatives of victims'' families, sent to help identify remains.\r\n\r\nAuthorities in Martinique also are to appoint two investigative judges to determine if anyone bears legal blame.\r\n\r\nVenezuelan investigators were focusing on the possibility of contaminated fuel or some other fuel problem that led both engines to fail simultaneously, said a Venezuelan emergency official.\r\n\r\nPanamanian authorities, however, said they found no evidence of tainted fuel and that the plane had plenty of fuel for the trip.\r\n\r\nThe pilot radioed the nearest airport before the crash, saying both engines had failed, and requested permission for an emergency landing.\r\n\r\nOfficials said the plane apparently fell into a steep descent minutes later.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6cf0d47f99967a3220df73d6598791f6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Four diplomats were released before the flight to Havana and full political asylum for the militants. Colombian officials said that the negotiated solution to the tense stalemate included a privately raised payment of two million dollars and the prompt release of all remaining hostages upon landing in Havana. The final settlement was arranged during meetings held between a petite, hooded woman guerrilla and government officials. A team led by Dr Tom Farer and representing the organisation of American states' human rights commission later served as a mediating force, guaranteeing that military trials of leftists still in Colombian prisons would be monitored by the OAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3e5fc8a40c7dd95d91e84b12e3908261 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of FARC troops \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nColombian peace commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo met the newly re-elected President Alvaro Uribe \r\nafter relatives of kidnap victims chided the newly re-elected leader for not mentioning their loved ones in his victory speech. \r\nRestrepo said in a statement Uribe wanted to \"search for new peace paths with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,\" or FARC.\r\nUribe was re-elected Colombia's president after a landslide victory on Sunday in which he won 62 percent of the vote - 40 percent more than his nearest rival.\r\nBut in his 45-minute victory speech, Uribe failed to mention his strategy for bringing the leftist rebels to the negotiating table. \r\nInstead he focused on economic achievements like a free trade agreement reached with the United States.\r\nThe FARC is believe to hold more than 60 prominent hostages, including three American defence contractors captured when their small plane crashed into a FARC stronghold in the jungle in 2003.\r\nA doubling of the defence budget and sharp increase in troop strength allowed the law-and-order Uribe to force the FARC to retreat into the jungle during his first term, helping to dramatically reduce what's still one of the world's highest kidnapping and murder rates.\r\nDespite the military advances, most analysts believe it's impossible for the government to defeat the 15,000-strong guerrilla army on the battlefield. \r\nDuring the campaign, Uribe acknowledged the time for talks was approaching.\r\nAnalyst and political scholar from the University del Rosario, Vicente Torrijos said that \" if President Uribe doesn't get any answers from them (in order to reach an agreement ) he will come off to be as obstinate and radical as he has been so far during his presidency and as radical as the FARC is.\" \r\nThe FARC has resisted the government's peace attempts so far.\r\nA few months ago, a proposal backed by France, Spain and Switzerland to exchange the hostages for FARC members held in prison failed to take off, with FARC leaders vowing they'd never strike a deal with Uribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9d439d0fa4c5af91cc3d2345e5a06f47 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Free video about permafrost layer. This free video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this permafrost layer video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe permafrost is the layer of ice permanently on the surface levels of the floor of the very cold regions or glacial, such as the tundra. It can be found in circumpolar areas of Canada, Alaska, Siberia, Tibet, Norway and in several islands of the Atlantic Ocean south as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. We have also found this phenomenon on the surface of Mars. Permafrost can be divided into permafrost, the frozen layer deeper, outermost layer usually thaw. For hundreds of thousands of years, the Arctic permafrost has accumulated large reserves of organic carbon.\n\nPermafrost form where the annual average temperature is -1 ° C and the annual precipitation does not exceed 1000 mm. Thus, the large permafrost areas in the world are in the polar regions to the Arctic and Antarctic tundra, in large parts of the boreal forest areas, but also in all areas which meet the conditions for permafrost, such as high mountains. As permafrost zone is called \"the circumpolar region eternal frozen ground, the tundra of northern continents, the large forest areas and offshore areas of the seabed.\n\nGeographically, there are large parts of northern Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Eastern Siberia. Approximately 20 to 25% of the land area of the earth is permafrost, and Greenland to 99%, Alaska at 80%, Russia 50%, Canada up to 20% are 40 to 50% and China from permafrost. Permafrost areas is also available in high mountain regions such as the Alps. You are the last ice age, when the ground froze places up in several 1000 meters depth. In addition to these fossil permafrost areas in the Alps will take place today - albeit very limited - even recent permafrost formation instead.\n\nIn addition, there are also submarine permafrost, so permafrost at the bottom of the seas. By density anomaly of the water actually physically impossible to explain this as follows: by the static sea level variation in the last ice age were many continental shelves, which are now back under water, above sea level, making the soil up to several 100 meters depth were able to develop permafrost. \n\nIn the wake of global warming a northward migration in recent decades has been the permafrost in North America and to a lesser extent in Eurasia observed. The consequences are damage to roads and houses, now where the permafrost thaws only on morass stand. Moreover, in this case in permafrost-bound large amounts of methane into the atmosphere from escaping. This process would be a strengthening of the warming since the global warming potential of methane is about 25 times as large as that of CO 2.\n\nThe thawing of permafrost makes short term and locally for already significant and threatening changes in topography. In areas with permafrost therefore buildings are built primarily on stilts that reach down into the permanently frozen areas of the soil and thus stand on firm ground. A geothermal -use heat pump heating can cause an artificial permafrost if the withdrawn heat energy can no longer be adequately replenished by the environment. In this case forms around the heat exchanger coils in the ground a block of frozen ground, which significantly reduces the heating power.\n\nThe layer or thaws and freezes again, the active layer mentioned. In the active layer can grow plants in the permafrost layer is not. The thickness of the active layer depends on the weather and changes with the years, but it is usually between 60 and 360 cm. The thickness of the permafrost could amount to tens of meters (at Barrow in Alaska was once measured more than 400 meters). Except to the mainland, permafrost also for Antarctic and Arctic islands like Bouvet Island.\n\nA major city that is built on the permafrost is the Russian city Yakutsk in northeastern Siberia with more than 200,000 inhabitants. The average annual temperature is around -9. The permafrost layer is according to locally obtained data (the Permafrost Institute, July 2010) is approximately 300 meters thick.\n\nMeasurement of the depth and extension of the permafrost could be a clue to study the greenhouse effect can be and in recent times (1999 and 2001) records are established for the thawing of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia. Accurate data, however, collected only since circa 1970, so that no final conclusions can be drawn.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!",

Located 60 kilometers west of\r\nMoscow, the Tamanskaya division has some of the best-trained and\r\nbest-equipped troops in the Russian armed forces. Other army\r\ndivisions have to cope with shortages of coal, food, bullets and\r\nother crucial supplies, but the Tamanskaya troops are relatively\r\nwell off. The Tamanskaya division is known for being an arm of the\r\ngovernment. More than once it has come to the Kremlin's rescue.\r\nDuring the August 1991 attempt to overthrow Soviet leader Mikhail\r\nGorbachev, Tamanskaya troops surrounded Russia's White House in\r\nMoscow in a symbolic move to demonstrate their loyalty. They were\r\ncalled into Moscow again in October 1993 and refused to use their\r\nweapons to bring down President Boris Yeltsin. Public attention is\r\nonce again turning to the Tamanskaya division in view of the\r\napproaching presidential elections in June. There is speculation\r\nthat Yeltsin might call off the election if his chances of\r\nemerging victorious appear threatened. Should the opposition\r\ndecide to challenge a cancellation, the Tamanskaya division would\r\nlikely play a crucial role.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWS: \r\n\r\n(RUSSIA) \r\n\r\nSnow-covered military training field west of Moscow.

Some are killed in the attempt.\n\nLed by senior French and British police commanders, the new centre will report to both interior ministers.\n\nNew measures include increased French police numbers and British-funded fencing, CCTV and other security equipment to protect the tunnel entrance in Calais, the Home Office said.\n\nOperator Eurotunnel (GETP.PA) will receive unspecified \"support\" to deploy more security guards at the site, it added.\n\nThe growing refugee crisis will also feature in talks between French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday, as southern European states bearing the brunt of the influx press for a concerted EU-wide response.\n\nFrance wants to set up processing centres for speedier treatment of asylum applications at Europe's main entry points and use development policy to enlist better cooperation from transit countries, Fabius said.",

      "description": "Free video about Shamanism. This video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be re-used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this Shamanism video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe Shamanism refers to a class of traditional beliefs and practices similar to animism that ensure the ability to diagnose and cure human suffering. A second group of anthropologists discussed the term shamanism, saying it is a word for a specific cultural institution, to include any healer of any traditional society, it produces a false uniformity between these cultures and creates the misleading idea of the existence of a religion before all others. Others accuse them of being unable to recognize the commonalities between the various traditional societies.\n\nShamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces and spirits of parallel dimensions that coexist simultaneously with ours, affecting all the manifestations of life. In contrast to animism, in which every member of society involved the practice, shamanism requires specialized knowledge or skills.\n\nThere are many variations of shamanism in the world; the following are shared by all forms of shamanism beliefs: 1 -there clarify that comes from shamanism \"shaman\", who is typical of eastern Siberia, though, as Mircea Eliade notes in his attempt to make a general history shamanism, there are a variety of shamans scattered around the world, and characterizes them being medical and spiritual guides.\n\nShamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits that affect the lives of the living. Unlike organized religions such as animism or animatism that are led by pastors and that all members of a society practice, shamanism requires individualized knowledge and special abilities. Shamans act outside established religions, and traditionally act alone. Shamans can come together in associations, as have practitioners Tantric Indians.\n\nAccording to Kehoe, Eliade Shamanism is an invention synthesized from various sources unsupported by any direct research. Believes that what he and other scholars define as characteristic of shamanism, trances, chants, communication with spirits, cures, are practices that exist in shamanic cultures do not like some Judeo-Christian rituals. In your opinion, they are typical of many cultures that use them, and you can not include in a religion -call shamanism. Therefore, it rejects that shamanism is an ancient surviving religion of Palaeolithic.\n\nThis may not only reveal the visions animist hiding behind shamanism, but also express their relevance to the recent world where ecological problems do paradigms valid balance and protection. Just as shamanism itself, music and songs related to it in various cultures are diverse, far from being similar. In some cultures and in some cases, some songs related to shamanism also try to imitate natural sounds, sometimes through onomatopoeia.\n\nShamanism is considered by some to be the history of all organized religions, since it was born before the Neolithic. The pagan Greek was influenced by shamanism, as reflected in the stories of Tantalus, Prometheus, Medea and Calipso among others, as well as the mysteries, like those of Eleusis. Some of the shamanic practices of the Greek religion were copied later by religion of Romans.\n\nToday, shamanism survives mainly in indigenous peoples. His practice continues in the tundras, jungles, deserts and other rural areas, and also in cities, towns, suburbs, and villages around the world. It is particularly widespread in Africa, and also in South America, where there is called \"shamanism mestizo \".\n\nAlthough shamanism had a great tradition in Europe before the advent of monotheism, remained as a traditional organized religion only in Mari-El and Udmurtia, two semi-autonomous provinces of Russia. Siberia is a center of shamanism, inhabited by many different peoples. Many of the people who populate the Urals and Altai, have maintained these practices alive until modern times. Many of the ethnographic sources have been collected from people. Many groups of hunters and breeders of reindeer practiced shamanism as a living tradition also in modern times, especially those who have lived isolated until recent times as naganasan.\n\nShamanism is still practiced in South Korea, where the role of women represent shaman calls mudang, while few men are known as baksoo mudang. Both are usually members of lower classes. There is a great influence on the shamanic religion of Bon central Asia, and in Buddhism Tibetan ; Buddhism became popular among Tibetan shamans, Mongols, and Manchus in the early eighth century.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!",

This video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be re-used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this volcanic rocks video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe volcanic rocks or extrusive are those igneous rock that formed by cooling wash in the Earth's surface or magma. The rapid cooling of magma or lava turns into volcanic rock makes many small crystals are formed, also called microcrystals or fine grains in these rocks. Rapid cooling may also be full or partially composed of volcanic rocks glass. The most common volcanic rocks on Earth are the basalt followed by the andesite. Other volcanic rocks are rhyolite, the dacite and traquita to name a few.\n\nVolcanic rocks can be divided into those with no crystals visible to the naked eye, ie they have texture aphanitic, and those crystals visible to the naked eye, ie texture phaneritic. When large crystals, highlighting in the array is called porphyritic texture or porphyritic.\n\nThe differentiation of the magma from which the volcanic rocks produces its chemical composition can gradually vary in their ascent to the surface, resulting in different volcanic rocks. In turn, the inicales differences in composition of magmas, the assimilation of host rocks, or magma mixing, result in these differentiation processes follow different trends.\n\nIf cooling occurs slowly subsurface rocks form with crystals large referred plutonic rocks or intrusive, whereas if cooling occurs rapidly on the surface, for example, after eruption, rocks formed with invisible crystals known as rocks volcanic or extrusive. Most of the 700 types of igneous rocks that have been described are formed on the surface of the crust. Examples of igneous rocks are the diorite, the rhyolite, the porphyry, the gabbro, the basalt and granite.\n\nIgneous rocks make up approximately ninety-five percent of the top of the crust, but are hidden by a relatively thin layer but extensive sedimentary and metamorphic. Its minerals, and global chemical provide information on the composition of Earth's mantle, which comes magma originates igneous rocks, and temperature and pressure conditions prevailing when the rock was formed, or pre-existing rock that is melted.\n\nThe Lava is magma during its ascent through the crust, reaches the surface. When it surfaces, lava usually has temperatures ranging between 700 ° C and 1200 ° C. Unlike the magma cools slowly deep underground. Volcanoes are the first group formed by the eruption of lava and can be of many types, from smooth basalt volcanoes and surface slopes stepped up ash and lava cones typical andesite and rhyolite. Volcanoes can form boiler if the dome collapses inward, forming a crater. These characteristics often form lakes in it, then forming the lava in an island that is the new cone.\n\nThe lava domes are a mass of lava whose viscosity prevents you descend the flanks of the volcano and that accumulates on top of the chimney supply. The edges of the domes generally have very steep flanks and often are in unstable areas.\n\nThe volcanic lava tubes or pipes are tunnels formed inside lava flows as it flows. The surface of the melt on contact with the air (which is much colder) solidifies creating an excellent thermal insulator for molten lava flow to maintain the temperature in the basement. This is a very common mechanism in most basaltic flows, and allows the lava reach long distances, even to drain into the sea only by having fluid inside the tube.\n\nIn exceptional cases, a volcanic cone can be filled without lava erupt. The lava fills the caldera is known as a lava lake. Lava lakes do not usually last long, either return to the magma chamber once the pressure decreases or in erupting lava or pyroclastic eruptions.\n\nThe rocks formed by lava of different volcanoes, differ greatly in appearance and composition. If a wash rhyolitic cooled quickly, it can become obsidian. If left with bubbles of gas, the same lava can form pumice. Instead, slowly cooling, forms the rhyolite.\n\nThe rock is then placed in its field petrographic by calculating the standard. Indeed the classification of igneous rocks is based on the presence and exclusion of major minerals, we must reconstruct the mineralogy of the rock as if it had fully crystallized. For example if we take a tholeiitic basalt, which is part of the rocks supersaturated silica, we never meet again porphyritic quartz in rock since silica tends to stay in the mesostasis, it is only with the calculation of the standard which shows virtual minerals that we can correctly determine the rock.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!",

Not only has the goat managed to steal the tiger's heart, he has also muscled in on his bed, forcing the tiger to sleep on the roof of his shelter instead. Astonished keepers decided to name the goat Timur - meaning iron - in honour of its bravery.",
