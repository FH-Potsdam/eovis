Photographer taking photo\r\nSTORYLINE: \r\nPakistani troops and rescue workers continued their struggle on Sunday, to help 1.3 (m) million victims of monsoon-triggered floods in the country's southwest.\r\nOn Sunday 265 people arrived in Karachi aboard the PNS Tariq, a ship of the Pakistani navy.\r\nA Pakistani navy official said that the people had been been rescued from Ormara and other coastal areas of Baluchistan.\r\n\"They were stranded there and they were in need obviously to be lifted and taken out of that area so we have brought them to here in Karachi and we have despatched them to their respective houses,\" Captain Mazhar said.\r\nZulfiqar Ali, a flood survivor said he and others were trapped on the Angora bridge.\r\n\"We were stranded there for two days.  Then the navy was informed, which brought us to Ormara.  They really helped us and finally brought us to Karachi,\" Ali said.\r\nEarlier 122 people including women, children and elders, were brought to Karachi.\r\nThe floods have left as many as 100 people dead in southwestern Pakistan, a senior relief official said on Sunday, as the government appealed for donations of tents to shelter about one million people left homeless by the flooding.\r\nThe deaths have occurred in the southwestern province of Baluchistan since Tuesday, when Cyclone Yemyin and rains triggered floods across a vast area, said Tariq Ayub, Baluchistan's home secretary, who is overseeing the flood relief operation.\r\nAuthorities said many of the casualties occurred due to drowning and people getting trapped under the debris of their collapsing homes.\r\nWith roads washed away by the flood waters leaving hundreds of villages cut off by swollen rivers, army helicopters have been flying over the affected areas and dropping tents, food and clean water to stranded villagers.\r\nBut more heavy rains are expected in the normally arid areas around coastal town of Turbat, about 650 kilometres (400 miles) southeast of Quetta, leaving rescue workers in a race against time to get as much aid to victims as possible before they are cut off by floods once again. \r\nWorkers from local welfare group, the Edhi Foundation, have formed mobile kitchens and tour villages supplying the hot meals and clean water. \r\nVillagers elsewhere said they were still waiting for aid to arrive.\r\nOfficials have said a large number of people in Baluchistan's flood-hit area had no access to safe drinking water, raising the possibility of waterborne diseases. \r\nA Pakistani Navy spokesperson told reporters that rescue and relief operations were underway along the coastal belts of the Balochistan. \r\nHe said the PNS Kalimaat, carrying food aid, had reached Ormara and two medical camps were being set up in Gawadar and Pasni. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/98494ef009fca9b6e355be9ad6bddfb8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Aerial of crowd of homeless people from Nasirabad district\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nPakistan called on the international community to rush aid to some one (m) million people left homeless by massive flooding amid forecasts on Monday that still more rain would be dumped on the stricken areas in coming days.\r\nFloods due to a cyclone and rain since 23 June have left as many as 211 people dead in two provinces of southern Pakistan, a senior relief official said on Monday, but unofficial estimates are considerably higher.\r\nSome 500 people have died across the subcontinent, in Pakistan, India and Afghanistan, since the start of the monsoon season in early June.\r\nFollowing a two-day tour of the flooded area on Sunday, Pakistan Prime Minister Shaukat Aziz asked for relief and rehabilitation aid from foreign countries, international agencies and private donors.\r\nHe said more helicopters would be added to army efforts to ferry food, medicine and other relief supplies to areas of Baluchistan province which was hit by Cyclone Yemyin last Tuesday.\r\nIn Nasirabad, 50 kilometres (31 miles) west of Turbat, Baluchistan on Monday, aid was seen being loaded onto helicopters and dropped into the region. \r\n\"Today we are dropping our medical teams in different places like Nasirabad and Alumdar. In the mornings we drop the teams and in the afternoon we come and pick them up again and take them back to base. We are dropping relief goods like food stuffs, medicines, tents, mineral water, lots of it,\" said Major Shahid Saeed, a pilot from one of the helicopters delivering aid to the victims. \r\nThe military said Pakistani and Chinese engineers had reopened the Karakoram Highway, which runs between the two countries. \r\nThe road link was severed by heavy, rain-spawned landslides near the 4,733-metre (15,528-feet) Khunjrab Pass.\r\nIn the Baluchistan city of Turbat, one of the worst-affected areas, doctors reported an influx of patients, many of them children, suffering from nausea, diarrhoea and other water-borne diseases.\r\nThe flooding has also spread in recent days into adjacent Sindh province to the east, where some 200-thousand people were rendered homeless in Shahdad Kot district after waters from a canal spilled over protective embankments, provincial relief commissioner Munir Ahmed said on Monday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d5da848e25fc7de5d4e4d8e67c8f7c34 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

At least a thousand crossed at Chaman, on the border between Afghanistan and the southwestern Pakistani province of Baluchistan.\r\nMany came from the Taliban stronghold of Kandahar and said they were fleeing American bombs.\r\n\r\n0020 \"There was continuous bombardment,\" this man said, \"and it wasn't against the military bases - it was on civilian vehicles.

And if this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world. So they will threaten the people but their capacity and capability is now not that much. And whosoever, the aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security.\"\r\n7. Wide of news conference ending\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nPakistan's government vowed on Friday to protect foreign aid workers against attacks from the Taliban, who have issued a veiled threat against relief organisations helping out in the country's flooding crisis. \r\nThe comments came as hundreds of thousands of people fled floodwaters after the surging River Indus smashed through levees in two places, but many refused to leave the danger zone while others took shelter in an ancient graveyard for Muslim saints.\r\nThe Taliban threat is likely to complicate the massive relief effort, while more than 8 (m) million people are in need of emergency assistance across the country.\r\nThe United Nations, the Pakistani army and a host of other local and international relief groups have been rushing aid workers, medicine, food and water to the affected regions, but are unable to reach many people.\r\nThe Pakistani Taliban on Thursday hinted they might attack the foreign aid workers. The militant network has a history of attacking aid groups, including agencies under the UN umbrella.\r\nMilitant spokesman Azam Tariq said the US and other countries were not really focused on providing aid to flood victims but had other motives he did not specify.\r\nPakistan's information minister promised to protect those who are helping in flood relief efforts. \r\n\"The aid workers, health workers who have come here, federal agencies and the provincial agencies, like police and others, as well, we will provide them proper security,\" Qamar Zaman Kaira told reporters. \r\nHe said the Taliban are trying to use the crisis to their advantage. \r\n\"The Taliban are basically threatening the whole nation, the whole world,\" he said. \r\n\"If this mess goes on, then this is in their benefit, this is in the benefit of all those who are against the interests and against the peace of Pakistan and the region and the world.\" \r\nHowever, he added that the Taliban's \"capacity and capability\" had been weakened. \r\nThe United States - which has launched scores of missile attacks against militant targets in the far northwest over the last 2 1/2 years - hopes to improve its highly unpopular image in Pakistan through its aid efforts. It has deployed 19 civilian and army helicopters to ferry aid and victims.\r\n\"Our brothers and sisters who live there face this difficult situation,\" he said. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b25c96209eedd444ef7bcd34b8fe3b16 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Many homes in the area were already submerged. \r\nAuthorities piled stones and sandbags to strengthen embankments protecting the city of Shadad Kot in Sindh from rising waters as the floods moved slowly south after leaving thousands of square kilometres (miles) of destruction in their wake.\r\nOn the eastern side of the city, the embankment was under pressure from nine-foot high waters, said Yaseen Shar, the top administrative official there.\r\nMost of the city's 350-thousand people have moved to relief camps or to towns and cities away from the danger.\r\nLocal charities, the Pakistani army and international agencies are providing food, water, medicine and shelter to the displaced, but (m) millions have received little or help. \r\nAid officials warn that waterborne diseases like cholera now posed a real threat.\r\nThe disaster has left around six (m) million people homeless from the mountainous north to the plains in the south, where the floods are expected to drain into the Arabian Ocean in the coming days and weeks.\r\nThe shaky government has come under criticism for its response, and will require (b) billions of dollars in foreign aid to rebuild.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b52148af56199626fb01f0464d5a1d3e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

I am living in misery,\" said one flood victim. \r\nIn southern Pakistan, the river Indus is now more than 15 miles (25 kilometres) wide at some points - 25 times wider than during normal monsoon seasons.\r\nMany flood victims are living in muddy camps or overcrowded government buildings, while thousands more are sleeping in the open next to their cows, goats and whatever possessions they managed to drag with them. \r\nThe UN has appealed for 460 (m) million US dollars to help Pakistan get immediate relief, but officials have said the country will need (b) billions to rebuild after the waters recede.\r\nPakistan was already struggling to battle a violent Islamist militant movement on its soil, and its offensives were considered important to the US goals in the war in neighbouring Afghanistan.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5a1bcdbe7a5149c1b1651c7c9246d756 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of journalists\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nPakistan toned down its Independence Day celebrations on Saturday amid a flooding disaster that has displaced (m) millions of its citizens.\r\nOfficials cancelled the colourful, fireworks ceremony normally held at midnight on August 14, the anniversary of Pakistan's creation and independence from Britain in 1947. \r\nBut smaller events still went ahead, including a wreath-laying ceremony at the Quaid-e-Azam mausoleum in Karachi, where Pakistan's founder Mohammad Ali Jinnah is buried.\r\nSindh Province Governor Ishrat Ul Ibad Khan and Chief Minister Qaim Ali Shah laid wreaths on the grave, accompanied by a guard of honour. \r\nSindh Province has been hit hard by the flooding. Fresh flood water swelled the River Indus on Saturday, threatening more cities, towns and villages in the province.\r\nIn a televised address to the nation Prime Minister Yousuf Raza Gilani said 20 (m) million were now homeless. \r\nHe did not elaborate, and it was unclear how many of those people were briefly forced to leave their homes and how many had lost their houses altogether.\r\nGilani also participated in a flag-raising ceremony on Saturday morning. \r\nThe floods have disrupted the lives of at least 14 (m) million people - 8 percent of the population. \r\nTriggered by unusually heavy monsoon rains, the floods have swept south through the country.\r\nIn southern Pakistan, the River Indus is now more than 15 miles (25 kilometres) wide at some points - 25 times wider than during normal monsoon seasons.\r\nThe UN said on Saturday that a case of cholera has been confirmed in Pakistan's northwest and aid workers expect it is not isolated.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bea0245ea582827fb2ae8d954d13e192 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Close-up of flood victims standing and laying beside rail track \r\nSTORYLINE\r\nMore rain soaked flood-ravaged Pakistan on Saturday and even heavier downpours were forecast for coming days, deepening a crisis which Pakistani officials estimate as affected as many as 13 million (m) people throughout the South Asian nation.\r\nAbout 1,500 people have died, most of them in the northwest, the hardest-hit region. \r\nMass evacuations are under way in the southern province of Sindh after the Indus River rose there.\r\nThe intense flooding that began about two weeks ago has washed away roads, bridges and many communications lines, hampering rescue efforts. \r\nIncessant monsoon rains have grounded many helicopters trying to rescue people and ferry aid, including six choppers manned by US troops on loan from Afghanistan.\r\nFloodwaters receded somewhat on Friday in the northwest, but downpours in the evening and early Saturday again swelled rivers and streams. \r\nPakistani meteorologists said heavy rains in Afghanistan were expected to make things even worse over the next 36 hours as the bloated Kabul River surged into Pakistan's northwest.\r\nThat will likely mean more woes for Punjab and Sindh provinces as well, as new river torrents flow east and south.\r\nIn the northwest and Punjab, floods have displaced 12 million (m) people, said an official with the National Disaster Management Authority. \r\nIn the Punjab city of Kot Addu, flood victim Ghulam Hafeeza walked through floodwaters with her three children, one of them sick, trying to make it to a hospital almost 90 kilometres (60 miles) from where she was. \r\n\"My son has been suffering from vomiting and diarrhoea since yesterday. Last night I took him to the hospital and he was injected with (IV) drips all night. I spent the whole night in hospital,\" she explained through tears. \r\nThe hospital she took her son to, the Government Civil Hospital of Kot Addu, has also been badly affected by the floods so a doctor advised her to travel the long distance to the Muzaffarghar hospital to get care for her sick child.\r\n\"How I can go? Nobody is with me, floodwater is everywhere. I don't have money. My house and everything was swept away. I have two sons and one daughter. I am carrying my children and finding my way,\" a desperate Hafeeza said as she continued her journey. \r\nNearby, some attempted to cross raging floodwaters using ropes while others carried their belongings through knee deep water. \r\nIn Sindh province, about 1 million (m) people have been evacuated or are being helped out of their homes, said the provincial irrigation minister.\r\nAuthorities have given varying tolls for the number of people among Pakistan's 175 million (m) impacted by the floods.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/43e5d4e5c9d12d609306e27bbc059587 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of ceremony\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe Pakistani army used boats and helicopters to move stranded villagers in the country's eastern Punjab province to higher ground as many parts of the region remained submerged in flood water.\r\nAn aerial view from a military helicopter showed a vast area around the districts of Kot Addu and Jhelum almost entirely underwater, with only rooftops sticking out from beneath the surface.\r\nThe province's relief commissioner said on Thursday that 1,261 villages had been affected by the floods, with around 1.5 (m) million people rendered homeless.\r\n\"So far, flood related deaths in Punjab province are around 15,\" Ikhlaq Tarar said.\r\nThe region's army commander said many people had ignored flood warnings and only realised the danger of the situation when water had already entered their cities, towns and villages.\r\nIn the country's south, meanwhile, authorities began evacuating half-a-million people as the worst monsoon rains in decades threatened new destruction.\r\nIn the northwest, the US army have joined international aid agencies, airlifting hundreds of stranded people and distributing emergency food.\r\nThe floods have already killed an estimated 1,500 people over the past week, most in the northwest.\r\nThe Pakistani government response to the floods has been criticized, especially because President Asif Ali Zardari left for a visit to Europe soon after the crisis began.\r\nAs fresh rains fell on Thursday, bloated rivers gushed toward southern Sindh province, where hundreds of thousands of the most impoverished Pakistanis live along the water because of fertile soil.\r\nMany flood victims have also complained that aid is not reaching them fast enough or at all.\r\nPakistani Prime Minister, Yusuf Raza Gilani, said on Thursday that evacuations had been the biggest issue for the government.\r\n\"The big issue was evacuating these people.  We are evacuating them and, afterwards, providing them with relief. To provide them with tents, food, protection, shelter and medicines,\" he said, speaking in Islamabad.\r\nGilani added that the government is starting to assess the damage with the help of the World Bank and the Asian Development Bank.\r\n\"When all the assessment is completed, certainly we will compensate these people who were martyred (killed) and were swept away.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/466b72dc66d1bdbab030432710dba8fd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

While I was trying to flee, a child of mine was slipped away from my hands and was swept away by the gushing water,\" BiBi Shehnaz said.\r\n\"I do not know his whereabouts yet,\" she said, recounting a tale that has become all too familiar in the region. \r\nThe fresh rains in the hardest-hit northwest threatened to overwhelm a major dam and unleash a new deluge.\r\nRelief work for some 3.2 million people has been delayed by swamped roads, washed-out bridges and downed communication lines, and survivors have complained about government inaction. \r\n\"Government hasn't done enough for us, I will appeal to the government at least to help the children,\" said one villager Tuesday. \r\nThe loss of so many crops was one reason the UN's World Food Program estimated that some 1.8 (m) million Pakistanis would need food assistance for at least the next month.\r\nAside from farmers, many victims have small businesses that have been destroyed and won't have the means to buy food for their families, a WFP\r\n(World Food Programme) spokeswoman said in Geneva.\r\nThe northwest is the epicentre of Pakistan's battle against al-Qaida and the Taliban. \r\nAlongside military and police operations, the government - with the support of the West - has tried to improve its services and living standards there to blunt the appeal of militancy.\r\nThe Pakistani army, which has the helicopters, boats and infrastructure needed for relief work, is delivering food, medicine and tents, as are government agencies and several different political parties and welfare organisations.\r\nBut many flood victims were unhappy with the response. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6f6f663488c1892cc317baa84d0235e4 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of area under flood water\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nRescue workers struggled on Sunday to save more than 27,000 people still trapped by massive flooding in Pakistan's northwest that has killed over 900 people and destroyed thousands of homes, officials said.\r\nThe effort has been aided by a slackening of the monsoon rains that have caused the worst flooding in decades in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa province. \r\nBut as flood waters have started to recede, authorities have begun to understand the full scale of the disaster.\r\nIn Nowshera city - where water levels were dropping on Sunday - some people were slowly making their way back to their houses.\r\nShair Dad, a timber shop owner, said his business has been badly affected by the floods.\r\n\"I haven't covered my losses in ten years, we are buying this wood on credit, I don't know how I will be able pay it back,\" he said on Sunday.\r\nThe death toll from the flooding has risen to 903 people, said Mujahid Khan, the head of rescue services for the Edhi Foundation, a private charity.\r\nThe worst hit areas have been the districts of Swat and Shangla, where more than 400 people have died, he said.\r\nAuthorities have deployed 43 military helicopters and over 100 boats to try to rescue some 27,300 people still trapped by the floods.       \r\nThe military has deployed 30,000 army troops who had evacuated 19,000 trapped people by Saturday night, said an army spokesman. \r\nBut the scale of the disaster has strained the resources of a government already grappling with a faltering economy and a brutal war against the Taliban.\r\nThe floods have caused an acute shortage of fruits and vegetables in the northwest because many of the hardest hit areas were the key centres of production, officials said.\r\nThe threat of disease loomed as well as some evacuees arrived in temporary camps with fever, diarrhea and skin problems.\r\nA variety of nations and aid organisations have begun to mobilise a response to the flood disaster.\r\nThe US delivered 380,000 food packages, four rescue boats and two water filtration units to the Provincial Disaster Management Authority, said a spokesman for the Provincial Disaster Management Authority.\r\nThe US Embassy in Islamabad has also announced it will provide 12 prefabricated steel bridges to temporarily replace some of the spans damaged by the water.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, Pakistani officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/7da343e1357b0bb25d7a3d9571210bcf \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

This time we have some medicine and some medicine will come after some time.\"\r\n11. Civil defence member walking with box of medicine \r\n12. Emergency kit at civil defence camp\r\n13. Mid of flood water in Indus river\r\n14. Wide of flood water in Indus river \r\nSTORYLINE \r\nFlooding in Pakistan has killed more than 800 people in a week, a government official said on Saturday as rescuers struggled to reach marooned victims and some evacuees showed signs of fever, diarrhoea and other waterborne diseases.\r\nThe flooding caused by record-breaking rainfalls caused massive destruction in the past week, especially in the northwest province, where officials said it was the worst deluge since 1929. \r\nThe United Nations estimated on Saturday that some 1 (m) million people nationwide were affected by the disaster, though it didn't specify exactly what that meant.\r\nThe information minister for the northwest province, Mian Iftikhar Hussain, said reports coming in from various districts across the northwest showed that more than 800 people had died due to the flooding. Many people remain missing.\r\nFloodwaters were receding in the northwest, officials said, but fresh rains were expected to lash other parts of the country in the coming days.\r\nIn Dera Ismail Khan, a military helicopter landed with soldiers bearing relief supplies. \r\nBut Anwar Ullah Khan, a civil defence official, complained that they weren't receiving enough aid. \r\nHe said that there weren't any vehicles available to take injured people to hospital, nor have they received any money to help buy medicine. \r\nA doctor treating evacuees at a small relief camp in Nowshera in the northeast said some had diarrhoea and others had marks appearing on their skin, causing itching. \r\nChildren and the elderly seemed to have the most problems, Mehmood Jaa said.\r\nRescuers were using army helicopters, heavy trucks and boats to try reaching flood-hit areas, the UN said. It reported that thousands of homes and roads were destroyed, and at least 45 bridges across the northwest were damaged.\r\nThe destruction is slowing the rescue effort, said a government official in Khyber-Pakhtoonkhwa, the northwest province.\r\nThe head of the Pakistan Meteorological Department, said that no more rain was expected in the next few days for the northwest and that floodwaters there were receding. \r\nBut Punjab province in the east, Sindh province in the south, and Pakistan's side of the disputed Kashmir region all could expect a lashing over the next three or four days, he said.\r\nFlooding has already affected some of those regions, with more than 21 people dying in Kashmir. A plane crash that killed 152 people in Islamabad on Wednesday also occurred during stormy weather.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5f93b4cb3f3fc17630357976069c8491 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of relief workers cooking food for displaced people\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThousands of Pakistani villagers were flushed from their homes in the southern Sindh province, as authorities and international aid groups struggled to respond to Pakistan''s second major bout of flooding in just over a year.\r\nResidents of Tando Bago, in the worst-hit district of Badin, about 200 kilometres from Karachi, were leaving their flooded houses with only the belongings they could carry with them.\r\nMonsoon rains since early August have killed more than 220 people, damaged or destroyed some 665-thousand homes and displaced more than 1.8 (m) million people in Sindh province, according to the government and the UN, which on Sunday made an emergency appeal for funding.\r\nDuring the past weeks, flood victims have been camping out on roadsides and dry fields, receiving aid from charities.\r\nAli Akbar, a displaced Pakistani living in a camp near Tando Bago said he and his family have been brought to a camp by a Pakistani aid group, the Al Khidmat Foundation, where they receive medical help and food.\r\nSindh saw similar scenes during last year''s floods, which at their peak affected all four of the country''s provinces and triggered a massive international aid response. \r\nWhile some districts in the region have been flooded out twice, many of the hardest-hit towns and villagers this year were unaffected in 2010.\r\nThe return of the floods is testament to the powerful penetration of the monsoon rains that envelop much of Asia at the end of summer. \r\nAs the rain did last year, the floods are undercutting the legitimacy of the shaky government, which is widely disliked and struggling against Islamist militants, political turmoil and massive economic problems.\r\nIn 2010, the floods followed the course of the River Indus and its tributaries from the foothills of the Himalayas to the flatlands of Sindh, where the river empties out into the Arabian Sea.\r\nMany of the countries that helped out then, including the US, have mobilised again this year to assist victims.\r\nThe US said it paid for food packages for 23-thousand families and its local partners will soon begin handing out tents, clean water and other supplies.\r\nJapan and China have also pledged relief goods or money, according to the Pakistan government.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8d3fb6821706218005905e74976d0bc8 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide of news conference\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe UN special envoy for assistance to Pakistan said on Thursday that more needs to be done to help those affected by last year's devastating floods.\r\nThe comments by Rauf Engin Soysal came as Pakistan marked the first anniversary of the country's worst ever floods that inundated a chunk of the country the size of the United Kingdom.\r\nThe flood that struck Pakistan in July 2010 represented one of the most devastating natural disaster of the decade, submerging almost one fifth of the country, killing 2000 people, affecting 20 (m) million and destroying 1.6 (m) million homes.   \r\nReconstruction is predicted to cost up to 10.9 (b) billion US dollars, almost one-quarter of Pakistan's national budget. \r\nIt is unclear how Pakistan will come up with the money, and some flood victims complain that corruption has prevented them from benefiting from funds that are available.\r\nZafar Iqbal Qadir, chairman of Pakistan's National Disaster Management Authority, said that Pakistani government was willing to provide those who have been affected with \"proper housing\", however the government does not have the funds for their construction at this point.\r\nThe problem could get worse this year because Pakistan's threshold for coping with flooding is lower. \r\nMany of last year's victims are extremely vulnerable, and much of the flood infrastructure that was damaged, such as bunds and dikes, has not been repaired.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8f4e96cd3bb027f28dd3a9531eda9447 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Distressed by growing extremism, lack of development and discriminatory policies of Islamabad, the people of Pakistan occupied Kashmir want to be a part of India, claimed Moulana Syed Athar Hussain Dehlavi, the chairman of the Anjuman Minhaj-e-Rasool. Dehlavi, who visited PoK after the devastating floods last year, said people there favour a referendum so that they can vote to join back to India. In September last year, when Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif visited the flood-affected areas of PoK, he was greeted with slogans “Go Nawaz Go”. It reflected the frustration of the people with regard to the apathy of the Pakistan government in dealing with the very critical situation. The people in PoK are fed up with the atrocities committed against them by the Pakistani establishment for decades. The region has always been neglected by Islamabad and used for nurturing terror camps. The people of PoK are shocked after Pakistan signed more than 50 pacts worth an estimated USD 46 billion in infrastructure projects as part of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor. The corridor passed through Kashmir, will connect the city of Kashgar in western China with the Pakistani deep sea port of Gwadar.",

Out of 11,000 registered since 1999, as many as 2,500 are in Antioquia.  The pilot project consists of six stages, the first of which was the selection of the initial regions, and it is being followed by the Identification of the characteristics of the region. The deactivation and removal will be carried out by a special battalion of the army, accompanied by FARC rebels, who will show the troops where the land mines are located.

I came from so far, like from Asia to here. I came here to work hard, not for resting. If  I wanted to rest, I can rest in my home, in my country, said Sergeant Abdul Najid Haldary.\r\nAfghanistan is currently struggling to control its drug trade, especially opium. \r\nAn estimated 93 percent of the world's opium comes from Afghanistan, bringing in as much as 2 (b) billion US dollars (1.5 (b) billion euro) a year in profits.\r\nExperts say booming profits from the lucrative crop are being used to fuel the Taliban. \r\nColombia, on the other hand, has a long history of battling drug cartels.\r\nThe country remains remains the source of more than 90 percent of the world's cocaine, despite the recent unprecedented aerial fumigation of coca crops across the country.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2011c8ba36a6bbcab62fa8908e11127d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Delegation entering morgue  \r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nTeams from France and from the island of Martinique continued their investigation in Venezuela on Thursday into the crash of a passenger jet that killed all 160 on board. \r\n\r\nThe jet was carrying 152 passengers home from Panama to Martinique, a French overseas department in the Caribbean, when it crashed on Tuesday in Venezuela. \r\n\r\nForensic experts and equipment used to identify victims'' bodies arrived from France at the University of Zulia medical school in the western Venezuelan city of Maracaibo, where the bodies are being held in a morgue. \r\n\r\nEight Colombian crew members were also killed in the crash.\r\n\r\nCol. Antonio Rivero, the chief of Venezuela''s emergency agency, said workers on Thursday were continuing to search for dead bodies and human remains at the crash site.\r\n\r\nColombia has grounded the airline that chartered the flight from Martinique while its civil air authority reviewed inspections that the small carrier had been required to perform.\r\n\r\nTeams of French experts travelled to Venezuela to aid in the investigation and help identify victims'' remains, officials said. \r\n\r\nA strong odour of decaying bodies permeated the air outside the medical school morgue in Maracaibo where the bodies were being identified.\r\n\r\nThree refrigerated shipping containers were placed outside for the remains to be loaded once identified.\r\n\r\nThree men and a woman arrived from Martinique at the morgue accompanied by the French consul and hurried inside without speaking to journalists who crowded around them. They were said to be representatives of victims'' families, sent to help identify remains.\r\n\r\nAuthorities in Martinique also are to appoint two investigative judges to determine if anyone bears legal blame.\r\n\r\nVenezuelan investigators were focusing on the possibility of contaminated fuel or some other fuel problem that led both engines to fail simultaneously, said a Venezuelan emergency official.\r\n\r\nPanamanian authorities, however, said they found no evidence of tainted fuel and that the plane had plenty of fuel for the trip.\r\n\r\nThe pilot radioed the nearest airport before the crash, saying both engines had failed, and requested permission for an emergency landing.\r\n\r\nOfficials said the plane apparently fell into a steep descent minutes later.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/6cf0d47f99967a3220df73d6598791f6 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Four diplomats were released before the flight to Havana and full political asylum for the militants. Colombian officials said that the negotiated solution to the tense stalemate included a privately raised payment of two million dollars and the prompt release of all remaining hostages upon landing in Havana. The final settlement was arranged during meetings held between a petite, hooded woman guerrilla and government officials. A team led by Dr Tom Farer and representing the organisation of American states' human rights commission later served as a mediating force, guaranteeing that military trials of leftists still in Colombian prisons would be monitored by the OAS.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/3e5fc8a40c7dd95d91e84b12e3908261 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of FARC troops \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nColombian peace commissioner Luis Carlos Restrepo met the newly re-elected President Alvaro Uribe \r\nafter relatives of kidnap victims chided the newly re-elected leader for not mentioning their loved ones in his victory speech. \r\nRestrepo said in a statement Uribe wanted to \"search for new peace paths with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia,\" or FARC.\r\nUribe was re-elected Colombia's president after a landslide victory on Sunday in which he won 62 percent of the vote - 40 percent more than his nearest rival.\r\nBut in his 45-minute victory speech, Uribe failed to mention his strategy for bringing the leftist rebels to the negotiating table. \r\nInstead he focused on economic achievements like a free trade agreement reached with the United States.\r\nThe FARC is believe to hold more than 60 prominent hostages, including three American defence contractors captured when their small plane crashed into a FARC stronghold in the jungle in 2003.\r\nA doubling of the defence budget and sharp increase in troop strength allowed the law-and-order Uribe to force the FARC to retreat into the jungle during his first term, helping to dramatically reduce what's still one of the world's highest kidnapping and murder rates.\r\nDespite the military advances, most analysts believe it's impossible for the government to defeat the 15,000-strong guerrilla army on the battlefield. \r\nDuring the campaign, Uribe acknowledged the time for talks was approaching.\r\nAnalyst and political scholar from the University del Rosario, Vicente Torrijos said that \" if President Uribe doesn't get any answers from them (in order to reach an agreement ) he will come off to be as obstinate and radical as he has been so far during his presidency and as radical as the FARC is.\" \r\nThe FARC has resisted the government's peace attempts so far.\r\nA few months ago, a proposal backed by France, Spain and Switzerland to exchange the hostages for FARC members held in prison failed to take off, with FARC leaders vowing they'd never strike a deal with Uribe.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/9d439d0fa4c5af91cc3d2345e5a06f47 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

We estimate the eruption of Calbuco will cause losses of up to about 30 percent,\" he said.",

      "description": "For More Latest News Subscribe us:\n\nPUERTO VARAS, CHILE:  Last week's spectacular twin eruptions of the Calbuco volcano will cost southern Chile's Los Lagos region, a tourism and agriculture hub, up to $600 million, a local business leader said Monday.\n\nThe region is struggling to clean up some 210 million cubic meters (7.4 billion cubic feet) of ash spewed by the volcano, which contaminated rivers, lakes and vast stretches of prairie.\n\nWith large swathes of farmland blanketed in the thick gray ash and debris, \"the agriculture and livestock industry will probably be the hardest hit,\" said Emir Jadue, head of the Chamber of Commerce in the town of Puerto Varas, near the volcano.\n\n\"The Los Lagos regional economy had annual turnover of $2 billion. We estimate the eruption of Calbuco will cause losses of up to about 30 percent,\" he said.",

      "description": "Volcano Calbuco erupted on April 22, 2015, for the first time in four decades. Located close to the cities of Puerto Varas and Puerto Montt in southern Chile. We (Jonas Dengler and Martin Heck) spend the prior couple of days on the neighboring volcano Osorno (~20km linear distance) shooting timelapses. After an amazing night under the nightsky we took the cable car downwards after a delay caused by repairs. Already late we headed south to catch the ferry on Routa 7 down to Patagonia. After 10min on the ferry we noticed a massive, almost nuclear looking cloud boiling upwards just were we left a few hours ago. Frenetically looking for a good outlook we then rushed to the only non-forested place to get a decent view of the show. We quickly put every bit of camera-equipment we could find on the constantly growing mushroom-cloud. We shot timelapses in 8K and 4K with a Pentax 645Z and Canon 6D. On the A7s we shot 4K video to the Shogun using Kingston HyperX SSDs. We filled almost all of our memory cards in the prior night so I had to do backups while shooting all this stuff.\nThis was for sure the most incredible show I've ever seen. I think this is a one in a lifetime event and I am so happy that we were able to capture it in all its glory.\nWe will also release a timelapse video of our 6 weeks trip to Patagonia soon.\nFACEBOOK: https://www.facebook.com/TimestormFilms | TWITTER: https://twitter.com/martinheck\nWEBSITE: http://www.timestormfilms.com/\n\nSoundtrack: We wish it was never light - Anamog\n\nAll footage is available for licensing (video in 4K, timelapses in 8K&4K).

      "description": "Air Tanker 131, a C-130Q, is seen in May, 2015 making two water drops -- instead of fire retardant -- on the Mud Lake Complex of fires in Big Cypress National Preserve in south Florida. This is an unusual tactic for large air tankers that normally drop retardant. It was a direct attack on the perimeter of the fire, rather than offset from the edge as they would do with retardant. In the United States, federal policy does not allow retardant to be dropped near water. Many areas in the Mud Lake Complex were near wetlands.\n\nCoulson Aviation attached a GoPro camera to the belly of their C-130Q to record the video.",

      "description": "Big Cypress National Preserve and the Southeast Region of the National Park Service are pleased to announce the release of the new short film, Mud Lake Mosaic. The documentary covers the management of the Mud Lake Complex, a series of wildfires caused by lightning strikes at Big Cypress in late spring 2015.\n\nThe Mud Lake Complex wildfires burned over 35,000 acres of Big Cypress National Preserve. Although naturally-ignited wildfires have helped shape the fire-adapted and fire-dependent Big Cypress landscape for thousands of years, fire managers cannot allow fires to freely roam the preserve without some degree of management. In the case of the Mud Lake Complex, major transportation corridors, private property and public safety all had to be protected.\n\nBig Cypress fully embraces the scientific role of fire in the preserve’s cycle of life - from the plants, to the trees, to the wildlife. The preserve’s goal in their response to wildfire is to manage fire so it can provide natural benefit to the area and its inhabitants without threatening human safety.\n\nThe initial fire, the Ellison fire, began on May 8. Fire managers established boundaries to contain the fire, but continued lightning strikes over the next 48 hours ignited numerous other fires throughout the preserve.\n\nBig Cypress requested help from the brightest minds in the firefighting and natural resources communities. Help came in from all over the country in the form of collaboration with other local, state and federal agencies and multiple interagency incident management teams.\n\nThe Mud Lake Complex lasted for over a month but resulted in a successfully executed strategy that helped to maintain and restore a resilient landscape. The film, Mud Lake Mosaic captures all the nuances of these challenging fires.",

      "description": "Content: Storms, Possible Tornadoes Lash Texas; 2 Still Missing october 31, 2015\nTexas Residents Face Tornado Damage and Continued Flooding\nAnother round of storms and strong winds moved east across Texas on Saturday, with three radar-confirmed tornadoes damaging homes and causing injuries in the Houston area.\n\nIt's the second day of turbulent weather in the state, where at least two people died in flood waters on Friday in central Texas and two were still missing from flash floods in the Austin area.\n\nAs the storms moved east, National Weather Service meteorologist Patrick Blood said a tornado went through Brazoria County near Alvin about 5 a.m. Saturday, injuring at least two people and damaging about 25 mobile homes in the community that's 30 miles south of Houston.\n\nThirty minutes later, a tornado hit the Houston suburb of Friendswood, collapsing the roof of one home. No one was injured because residents were not home, officials said. Another 30 or so homes had minor damage. And about 7 a.m. Saturday, between 10 and 30 homes were damaged by a tornado in a subdivision in eastern Harris County, Blood said.\n\nIn the Houston area, up to 8 inches of rain have fallen since Friday night, and will continue to fall until early Saturday afternoon, Blood said. That's resulted in flooded streets, which led officials to suspend public light-rail and bus transportation in the morning; limited rail service was restored around 11 a.m.\n\nThe Houston Fire Department said it had responded to more than 90 water rescues by midmorning Saturday.\n\n\"A lot of the feeder roads are under water and we have some bayous that are out of their banks, contributing to the flooding around the city,\" Blood said.\n\nUtilities in East Texas said 44,000 customers were without power. The National Weather Service issued a flash flood watch for areas near Houston, Galveston, Bryan, College Station, Tyler and Texarkana until Saturday afternoon.\n\nThe storms and suspected tornadoes, which forecasters say were caused by an upper-level disturbance from Mexico, socked an already-sodden swath of Texas that was still drying out from the remnants of Hurricane Patricia. Austin, San Antonio and surrounding areas were first hit Friday. Two people died when they were swept away by flood waters, and a man and a woman also were still unaccounted for in separate incidents.\n\nMore than 16 inches of rain soaked one neighborhood on Friday and Austin Bergstrom International Airport suspended all flights after a half-foot of water flooded the air traffic control tower; 40 flights were canceled there on Saturday.\n\nMeanwhile, a lazy creek cutting through Texas wine country, a popular getaway spot, swelled into a rushing torrent, sending eight members of a vacationing church group scrambling to a second floor before they were rescued by the National Guard.\n\nSimilar conditions in May — soaking storms on the heels of others — caused devastating flooding on the Blanco River that swept homes from foundations and killed families who were carried downstream. This time, the river swelled to about 26 feet in Wimberley, nearly twice the flood stage.\n\nMore than 70 people spent Friday night at shelters because of the flooding in Central Texas. Hundreds of high-water crossings were closed Saturday in Hays County, and some residents in southeast Travis County, near Austin, were asked to move to higher ground because of residual flooding.\nlink: http://abcnews.go.com/US/wireStory/search-missing",

So, we're like, \"Yay, the weather's great, we can get out.'\" But also in other parts, there's going to be a lot of fires starting, and a lot of glacial melt and a lot of flooding if the high mountains are producing a lot of ice melt, so there's like a trade off.\r\n7.

Mid of woman putting on sunscreen\r\n20. Wide of people in water\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nA heat wave hitting Alaska may not rival the blazing heat of Phoenix or Las Vegas, but to people in the 49th US state, the days of hot weather provoke mixed reaction.\r\n\"Visitors say it's really nice and locals say it's very dangerous. You know, because .... there's always like a pro and con,\" said Park Ranger, Marissa Wright on Tuesday. \r\n\"So, we're like, 'Yay, the weather's great, we can get out,' but also in other parts, there's going to be a lot of fires starting, and a lot of glacial melt and a lot of flooding if the high mountains are producing a lot of ice melt, so there's like a trade off.\" \r\nWith temperatures topping 80 degrees Fahrenheit (26.7 Celsius) in Anchorage, and higher in other parts of the state, people have been sweltering in a place where few homes have air conditioning.\r\nThey're sunbathing and swimming at local lakes, hosing down their dogs and cleaning out supplies of fans in at least one local hardware store. \r\n\"This summer has been extremely hot. We've had almost no rain. Last summer, it rained all summer long, but it's been really, really hot, nice and warm, no clouds, no nothing,\" said bikini clad local woman Kirstie McPherson.\r\nMid-June normally brings high temperatures in the 60s Fahrenheit (15-20 Celsius) in Anchorage and just a month ago, it was still snowing.\r\n\"It's just amazing that a couple of weeks ago, we had snow coming down and now it's gorgeous and in the 80s,\" said Anchorage resident Melissa Nelson.\r\nState health officials even took the unusual step of posting a Facebook message reminding people to slather on the sunscreen.\r\nOn Tuesday, the official afternoon high in Anchorage was 81 degrees Fahrenheit (27.2 Celsius), breaking the city's record of 80 Fahrenheit  (26.7 Celsius) set in 1926 for that date.\r\nOther smaller communities throughout a wide swath of the state are seeing even higher temperatures.\r\nThat record was set in 1969.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/43e71e228bef5fa115ff1707b792faf7 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Since I'm putting in a planter around each of them, I've taken some steps that won't be necessary for others. But you should get a good idea of one way to help ensure that you give your new tree the best chance at a long, healthy and productive life. This is particularly relevant in the US southwest desert.\nThanks to Jay for making an incredible tree mix.\nThanks to SEACAB for amazing wood chips.\nThanks to Susan over at Oleo Ranch for one mulberry\nThanks to Justin at Agriscaping Technologies for another mulberry and this variety of purslane.\nI met a guy at the SHADE conference that gave me a sample of Bio-Feed soil promoter. I've been adding it to my new structures and want to thank him for letting me test it. So far so good. I can't find your card though, so neglected your name. Sorry. :( \nThanks to you for watching. :)",

      "description": "This video was taken July 30, 2015. Watch in HD for better viewing. enjoy!\n\nHighway 4, known more commonly as the Ingraham Trail, extends from Yellowknife, Northwest Territories to Tibbitt Lake, approximately 70 km (43 mi) east of Yellowknife. It was built in the mid-1960s as the first leg of a 'road to resources' into the interior of the Arctic, stopping far short of its ultimate goal.\n\nThe highway is designated as a northern/remote route of Canada's National Highway System.\n\nAlthough the highway serves primarily recreational activities and area residences in this lake-dotted country it is, after the ice break-up on Great Slave Lake, the only access to Dettah from Yellowknife. The small Dene community is about 6.5 km (4.0 mi) from Yellowknife by ice road in winter or 27 km (17 mi) using the Ingraham Trail.\n\nFor about a month in late winter, a winter road to Lac de Gras is opened to trucking of mining supplies, the junction being along the Ingraham Trail. The road has taken a beating from the heavy trucks. This is shown on the first season of the American reality television series, Ice Road Truckers, which airs on History Channel. The Tibbitt to Contwoyto Winter Road also extends from the end of the Ingraham Trail to Contwoyto Lake in Nunavut, forming Nunavut's only connection to the road network in the rest of Canada.\n\nThe Ingraham Trail is named after Vic Ingraham, a pioneer Yellowknife businessman of the 1930s–40s. - Wikipedia.org\n\nTags: Aerial photography drone uav canada aerial video dji phantom 3 2 1 gopro camera  Aerial Photography Northwest Territories Canada Drone UAV Waterfalls Canada Yellowknife DJI Phantom 3 2 1 GoPro Camera awesome spectacular scenic view mountains landscape",

That is why you can see the mass population of the people from Kibumba running away.\" \r\n7, Wide of government soldiers. \r\n8. Mid of one government soldier carrying rocket launcher \r\n9.

Mid of displaced girl carrying a baby on her back.\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nU.N. peacekeepers used helicopter gunships against rebels in eastern Congo on Monday, trying to halt a rebel advance as government troops hastily retreated and civilians attacked U.N. headquarters demanding protection.\r\nIn what appeared to be a major retreat, hundreds of government soldiers pulled back from the battlefront north\r\nof Goma, the capital of North Kivu province, fleeing in tanks, jeeps, trucks and on foot.\r\nSoldiers honked their horns angrily as they struggled to push through throngs of displaced people poured onto the\r\nmain road. \r\nTens of thousands of civilians abandoned their homes ahead of the rebel advance.\r\nU.N. spokeswoman Sylvie van den Wildenberg said the peacekeepers in the gunships fired at rebel forces surging\r\non Kibumba, about 28 miles (45 kilometres) north of Goma.\r\nRebel leader Gen. Laurent Nkunda has threatened to take Goma in defiance of calls from the U.N. Security Council for him to respect a U.N.-brokered cease-fire signed in January.\r\nIt was the second time this year peacekeepers had fired on Nkunda's rebels. \r\nIn December, U.N. officials also used helicopters to repel the rebels, killing hundreds under their mandate to protect civilians in the vast Central African country that has been ravaged by years of dictatorship and civil war.\r\nRebel spokesman Bertrand Bisimwa told The Associated Press that rebel fighters were within seven miles of Goma.\r\nResidents of Katindo, a neighborhood three miles from downtown Goma, told the AP they heard bombs exploding late on Monday afternoon.\r\nAs the crowds reached the city, soldiers blocked access to the northern entrance of Goma, apparently fearing that\r\nrebels could be trying to infiltrate with the displaced civilians.\r\nEarlier on Monday, crowds of protesters attacked four U.N. compounds in Goma with rocks, venting outrage that the U.N. peacekeeping mission - the biggest in the world with 17,000 troops - has been unable to protect them from the rebels. \r\nResidents opposed to rebels, including Hutus and those who lived in refugee camps after fleeing earlier conflicts,\r\nfeel particularly threatened. \r\nThe crowds shattered windows and damaged cars at the main U.N. office, van den Wildenberg said. \r\nCongo's government has accused the Tutsi-led government that won power in Rwanda after the genocide of sending troops to support Nkunda - a charge Rwanda denies and the U.N. says is unfounded.\r\nThe rhetoric strengthens ethnic tensions amid fears Congo's conflict could again escalate beyond its borders. \r\nBack-to-back wars in DR Congo spilled into half a dozen neighbouring countries and destroyed much of the ravaged nation itself by 2002. \r\nRwanda officially withdrew its troops from DR Congo after a peace deal ended the country's 1998-2002 war.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/cdb63c83252855edcb3370a542f84552 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide shot of displaced people walking past a destroyed rebels' jeep \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nCivilians continued to flee fighting in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) on Saturday, after new clashes erupted  between government forces and government-backed Mai Mai militia, and rebels of General Laurent Nkunda's CNDP (Congres National Pour La Defense Du Peuple).\r\nIn the eastern town of Kiwanja, 80 kilometres (50 miles) east of Goma - where about 45,000 people have taken refuge - hundreds of displaced people were on the move, heading for a UN camp near the town.\r\nNkunda called a unilateral cease-fire last week when his forces reached the outskirts of Goma, but the truce has crumbled.\r\nOn Thursday, Human Rights Watch and local villagers accused Nkunda's rebels of killing dozens of men in civilian clothes who were suspected of supporting Mai Mai militia against the rebels.\r\nThe dead body of a uniformed man could be seen in front of a house on Saturday.\r\nA local man told AP Television News that rebels had killed civilians and left bodies piled up in houses. \r\nNkunda is blamed for a 10-week offensive that has forced 250,000 people from their homes as his fighters captured great swathes of eastern DRC, in a conflict that many fear will spread.\r\nThe conflict is fuelled by festering ethnic hatred left over from the 1994 slaughter of a half-million Tutsis in Rwanda, and DRC's civil wars from 1996-2002, which drew its neighbours into a rush to plunder its mineral wealth.\r\nNkunda defected from the army in 2004, saying he needed to protect his tiny Tutsi minority from Rwandan Hutu militias. He has since expanded his mission to \"liberating\" the DRC from an allegedly corrupt government.\r\nBut experts dismiss as fantasy his ambitions of marching on Kinshasa and deposing DRC President Joseph Kabila - the nation's first freely elected leader in nearly half a century.\r\nThe United Nations believes Nkunda has 6,500 men; he says he has 10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/725b4997fc741c7e7891495bc573143d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

We are just running while bullets fly from every part of the village,\" said one man as he made his way from his village to Goma, 50 kilometres (31 miles) away. \r\nThe UN force has failed to halt the fighting in the vast region of rural hills and forests, and both sides in the combat also accuse the United Nations of siding with the other.\r\nSunday's attack marked the second time rebels have seized Rumangabo army base since fighting resumed August 28 when rebel leader General  Laurent Nkunda went on the offensive, charging government troops had attacked and broken a cease-fire agreed in January.\r\nNkunda's fighters, who claim to be protecting the region's Tutsi minority, have occupied parts of Virunga National Park for nearly a year, but they attacked the headquarters for the first time before dawn on Sunday.\r\nThe park is home to 200 of the world's 700 remaining mountain gorillas, which are considered critically endangered. \r\nMany displaced civilians are malnourished and some are dying of hunger, the UN World Food Programme said on Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/273c4fee43c0edd63346f4cfd135d34a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Zoom into infant\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nA New York - based human rights NGO has announced that nearly 2.5 million people have died as a result of the three year war in the Democratic Republic of Congo, many from malnutrition and disease. \r\nNow the World Food Program (WFP) is saying that their humanitarian relief operation is in danger of collapse because of a lack of funding. \r\nSurrounded by a vast jungle and tribal militia allied to the government, Kongolo town has been cut off from the rest of Congo, its residents suffering from malnutrition, disease and abject poverty.\r\nWith the road, bridges and railway destroyed or too dangerous to use because of reportedly ruthless Mayi Mayi tribal militia, Kongolo's 50,000 residents' only link to the outside world are aid agency relief planes.\r\nIn the town's small hospital over 50 children are currently fighting a silent battle against malnutrition. \r\nEscaping from nearby villages many Congolese have come for help in Kongolo, where the WFP has been delivering supplies to the hospital, but the threat of Mayi-Mayi attack on the roads has stopped many from making the journey.\r\nThe latest strife in Congo erupted in August 1998, when Rwanda, Uganda and their Congolese rebel allies took up arms against then-President Laurent Kabila, accusing him of nepotism, warmongering and backing Rwandan and Ugandan rebels.\r\nZimbabwe, Angola and Namibia poured thousands of troops and military hardware into Congo in support of Kabila. \r\nFactions of Mayi Mayi, uncoordinated, tribally-based warriors fighting for local autonomy, have fought on both sides. \r\nUnder a peace agreement that has ended the fighting between the regular forces, the government is supposed to disarm and pacify the Mayi Mayi, but they have kept fighting.\r\nThe United Nations was only allowed to begin relief efforts in June, after a cease-fire took hold. \r\nBut the total destruction of roads, railways and the continuing Mayi Mayi attacks have forced relief agencies to use expensive airlifts. \r\nThe World Food Program (WFP) claim the operation is in danger of collapsing due to lack of funding.\r\nThe agency needs at least 175,000 U-S dollars to pay for the flights, which could help the people of Kongolo and other parts of northern Katanga province.\r\nThe airlifts are part of a larger 112 million U-S dollar effort to feed 1.3 million needy Congolese between now and December 2002. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2679962b188e0f0cf73340d616af6e0a \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Because these young people are pushing the boundaries of clean vehicle technology, presenting us and making us think about what we drive and what fuels the cars that we use,\" event director Chris Selwood said.\r\nEntrants came from 17 countries.\r\nThe team from the University of Michigan was confident of a strong performance before they left.\r\n\"With our qualifying position we feel pretty good about where we are, in terms of the rest of the pack and how our car will perform,\" said team leader Cameron Wyle.\r\nUnfortunately, the Americans ran into trouble only three kilometres (1,8 miles) from the start, when they collided with a support vehicle and were forced to retire.\r\nBelgium's Umicore team, which started the race on pole position, was an early leader as cars headed to the first checkpoint at Katherine, 330 kilometres (205 miles) south of Darwin.\r\nHowever, at the end of the first day, it was the Japanese team from Ashiya University who led the pack.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/2220c6142b82cba4fb505264f2ad6d42 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "STORYLINE:\r\nThe leaders of Australia and Indonesia agreed on Tuesday to strengthen maritime ties as part of a bid to combat people smuggling, after two boats carrying Australia-bound migrants capsized and left dozens dead in the past two weeks.\r\nThe debate over how to cope with the increasing flow of asylum seekers has intensified in Australia since the boat disasters, in which more than 90 people are believed to have been killed. \r\nTheir boats sank in the Indian Ocean between Indonesia and the Australian territory of Christmas Island, where Australia runs an immigration detention centre. \r\nAustralia's Prime Minister Julia Gillard and Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono met in the Northern Territory capital of Darwin to discuss how to handle the politically-charged problem, along with economic and trade issues.\r\nGillard said Australia would work with Indonesia's maritime search and rescue agency to help strengthen its communication abilities with vessels during sea disasters and would look into an exchange programme of search and rescue specialists.\r\n\"I welcome the strong cooperation we have with Indonesia on people smuggling, including Indonesia's law enforcement efforts against people smuggling syndicates,\" Gillard told reporters.\r\nYudhoyono said he and Gillard had discussed the importance of the Bali Process, an Asia-Pacific body against people smuggling and human trafficking, and noted that Indonesia was also suffering.\r\nNeither leader took questions from journalists.\r\nAustralia is a common destination for boats carrying asylum seekers from Afghanistan, Iraq, Sri Lanka and other poor or war-ravaged countries. \r\nMany asylum seekers travel first to Indonesia and then try to complete the journey to Australia aboard rickety, overcrowded fishing boats. \r\nThe boats generally head for Christmas Island, which is closer to Indonesia than to the Australian mainland.\r\nFollowing his meeting with Gillard, Yudhoyono told an Australia Indonesia Business Council gathering that he was optimistic about Indonesia's economic development course, \"despite the gloomy world economic situation.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/5a0e58c2ee6db50987e4f3df4835ddee \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Raw Video | About 90 Killed In Blast At Ghana Gas Station\nRaw Video | About 90 Killed In Blast At Ghana Gas Station\nRaw Video | About 90 Killed In Blast At Ghana Gas Station\n\n\nAn explosion at a petrol station in Ghana's capital killed around 90 people sheltering from a storm early on Thursday, emergency services said, in the worst disaster to strike the West African state in more than a decade.\n\nhttps://youtu.be/L6M9YZMZy-4\n\nThe force of the blast gave few a chance to escape. People were burnt beyond recognition where they stood under the station's awning, or trapped in the charred wreckage of cars and minivans parked on its forecourt.\n\nThe accident was caused by a fire at a nearby lorry terminal. Flames spread to the state-run GOIL petrol station via spilt fuel floating on flood water, fire brigade spokesman Prince Billy Anaglate said.\n\n\"It was an explosive fire and so the people sheltering at the filling station did not have an opportunity to escape,\" Anaglate said.\n\nIt was Ghana's worst disaster since more than 120 people died in May 2001 in a stampede at the national stadium during a football match, a police spokesman said.\n\nThe incident exposed Accra's vulnerability to storms, given poor drainage and weak infrastructure that has failed to keep pace with population growth after years of rapid economic expansion.\n\nLow-wage workers struggling to get home through the storm, with roads closed and minivan buses not running, formed the bulk of those caught in the explosion, witnesses said.\n\nSeveral other people were swept away by the seasonal storm in the coastal city and thousands more were made homeless as flood waters rose, officials said.\n\n\nVolcano News !!

Il se serait déclenché dans une résidence à proximité, puis se serait propagé aux pompes à essence qui ont explosé, selon des témoins.\n\nLa grande majorité des victimes s'étaient réfugiées dans la station-service pour s'abriter de pluies torrentielles à l'origine d'importantes inondations dans la capitale ghanéenne ces derniers jours.\n\n«Pour le moment, le chiffre confirmé atteint environ 90 (morts), mais je sais que ce sera plus que cela. Les agences concernées sont en train de faire le décompte», a déclaré le porte-parole de la police nationale, Arthur Cephas.\n\nLe président du Ghana, visiblement très ému, s'est rendu sur place et n'a pu que déplorer le très lourd bilan du sinistre.\n\nDe nouvelles précipitations sont attendues à Accra jeudi et vendredi.\nla presse.ca",

Watch how my first week of volunteering unfolded.\n\nThank you to CUSE and FYS of the University of Notre Dame for making my research and volunteerism possible! Scroll down for a short overview of my research. Thank you to Professor Mary Kearney for advising my research and helping shape my approach to similar topics!\n\n-\nWelcome to my YouTube channel, home to the Edupreneurship podcast with Zack Baker and my research video blogs. Want to get on the show or ask a question about education or my research? Tweet @mrpetefreeman!\n\nGlobal Mamas Internship Overview: Global Mamas is a 12-year-old NGO that began with six women and know impacts almost 600 Ghanaian women! My volunteerism/internship with Global Mamas involves me teaching IT/computer skills to the Mamas, marketing their products, storytelling their brand, and helping them achieve prosperity!\n\nGhana Research Overview: This study on “Effects of Fair Trade Entrepreneurship” aims to research the role of fair trade entrepreneurship in helping female Ghanaian fair trade entrepreneurs achieve financial security. This study contributes to larger body of research on the feminization of poverty. The feminization of poverty describes a phenomenon in which women represent disproportionate percentages of the world's poor. UNIFEM describes it as \"the burden of poverty borne by women, especially in developing countries.\" \n\nAccording to the Rural Poverty Portal, over 25 percent of Ghanaians live in poverty, and the majority are women. It is the goal of my research to understand how fair trade entrepreneurship impacts the financial well-being of Ghanaian female fair trade entrepreneurs. The study utilizes ethnographic research methods including literature review and interviews. The interviews are conducted in the shops and homes of female Ghanaian fair trade entrepreneurs, as well as in buildings that facilitate their entrepreneurial pursuits. The anonymous information collected from the study will be summarized into a report in order to provide insights and advice for the entrepreneurship discipline at the University of Notre Dame. The study will also serve to prepare the researcher (me!) for full-scale research in the future.\n\n\nLINKS:\nMy website - http://petefreeman.com\nCUSE's website: https://cuse.nd.edu/\nFYS's website: http://firstyear.nd.edu/\n\n--\nPete Freeman is a Lilly Scholar from the great state of Indiana.

      "description": "Free video about permafrost layer. This free video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this permafrost layer video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe permafrost is the layer of ice permanently on the surface levels of the floor of the very cold regions or glacial, such as the tundra. It can be found in circumpolar areas of Canada, Alaska, Siberia, Tibet, Norway and in several islands of the Atlantic Ocean south as South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands. We have also found this phenomenon on the surface of Mars. Permafrost can be divided into permafrost, the frozen layer deeper, outermost layer usually thaw. For hundreds of thousands of years, the Arctic permafrost has accumulated large reserves of organic carbon.\n\nPermafrost form where the annual average temperature is -1 ° C and the annual precipitation does not exceed 1000 mm. Thus, the large permafrost areas in the world are in the polar regions to the Arctic and Antarctic tundra, in large parts of the boreal forest areas, but also in all areas which meet the conditions for permafrost, such as high mountains. As permafrost zone is called \"the circumpolar region eternal frozen ground, the tundra of northern continents, the large forest areas and offshore areas of the seabed.\n\nGeographically, there are large parts of northern Canada, Alaska, Greenland and Eastern Siberia. Approximately 20 to 25% of the land area of the earth is permafrost, and Greenland to 99%, Alaska at 80%, Russia 50%, Canada up to 20% are 40 to 50% and China from permafrost. Permafrost areas is also available in high mountain regions such as the Alps. You are the last ice age, when the ground froze places up in several 1000 meters depth. In addition to these fossil permafrost areas in the Alps will take place today - albeit very limited - even recent permafrost formation instead.\n\nIn addition, there are also submarine permafrost, so permafrost at the bottom of the seas. By density anomaly of the water actually physically impossible to explain this as follows: by the static sea level variation in the last ice age were many continental shelves, which are now back under water, above sea level, making the soil up to several 100 meters depth were able to develop permafrost. \n\nIn the wake of global warming a northward migration in recent decades has been the permafrost in North America and to a lesser extent in Eurasia observed. The consequences are damage to roads and houses, now where the permafrost thaws only on morass stand. Moreover, in this case in permafrost-bound large amounts of methane into the atmosphere from escaping. This process would be a strengthening of the warming since the global warming potential of methane is about 25 times as large as that of CO 2.\n\nThe thawing of permafrost makes short term and locally for already significant and threatening changes in topography. In areas with permafrost therefore buildings are built primarily on stilts that reach down into the permanently frozen areas of the soil and thus stand on firm ground. A geothermal -use heat pump heating can cause an artificial permafrost if the withdrawn heat energy can no longer be adequately replenished by the environment. In this case forms around the heat exchanger coils in the ground a block of frozen ground, which significantly reduces the heating power.\n\nThe layer or thaws and freezes again, the active layer mentioned. In the active layer can grow plants in the permafrost layer is not. The thickness of the active layer depends on the weather and changes with the years, but it is usually between 60 and 360 cm. The thickness of the permafrost could amount to tens of meters (at Barrow in Alaska was once measured more than 400 meters). Except to the mainland, permafrost also for Antarctic and Arctic islands like Bouvet Island.\n\nA major city that is built on the permafrost is the Russian city Yakutsk in northeastern Siberia with more than 200,000 inhabitants. The average annual temperature is around -9. The permafrost layer is according to locally obtained data (the Permafrost Institute, July 2010) is approximately 300 meters thick.\n\nMeasurement of the depth and extension of the permafrost could be a clue to study the greenhouse effect can be and in recent times (1999 and 2001) records are established for the thawing of permafrost in Alaska and Siberia. Accurate data, however, collected only since circa 1970, so that no final conclusions can be drawn.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!",

Located 60 kilometers west of\r\nMoscow, the Tamanskaya division has some of the best-trained and\r\nbest-equipped troops in the Russian armed forces. Other army\r\ndivisions have to cope with shortages of coal, food, bullets and\r\nother crucial supplies, but the Tamanskaya troops are relatively\r\nwell off. The Tamanskaya division is known for being an arm of the\r\ngovernment. More than once it has come to the Kremlin's rescue.\r\nDuring the August 1991 attempt to overthrow Soviet leader Mikhail\r\nGorbachev, Tamanskaya troops surrounded Russia's White House in\r\nMoscow in a symbolic move to demonstrate their loyalty. They were\r\ncalled into Moscow again in October 1993 and refused to use their\r\nweapons to bring down President Boris Yeltsin. Public attention is\r\nonce again turning to the Tamanskaya division in view of the\r\napproaching presidential elections in June. There is speculation\r\nthat Yeltsin might call off the election if his chances of\r\nemerging victorious appear threatened. Should the opposition\r\ndecide to challenge a cancellation, the Tamanskaya division would\r\nlikely play a crucial role.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHOWS: \r\n\r\n(RUSSIA) \r\n\r\nSnow-covered military training field west of Moscow.

Some are killed in the attempt.\n\nLed by senior French and British police commanders, the new centre will report to both interior ministers.\n\nNew measures include increased French police numbers and British-funded fencing, CCTV and other security equipment to protect the tunnel entrance in Calais, the Home Office said.\n\nOperator Eurotunnel (GETP.PA) will receive unspecified \"support\" to deploy more security guards at the site, it added.\n\nThe growing refugee crisis will also feature in talks between French President Francois Hollande and German Chancellor Angela Merkel on Monday, as southern European states bearing the brunt of the influx press for a concerted EU-wide response.\n\nFrance wants to set up processing centres for speedier treatment of asylum applications at Europe's main entry points and use development policy to enlist better cooperation from transit countries, Fabius said.",

      "description": "Free video about Shamanism. This video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be re-used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this Shamanism video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe Shamanism refers to a class of traditional beliefs and practices similar to animism that ensure the ability to diagnose and cure human suffering. A second group of anthropologists discussed the term shamanism, saying it is a word for a specific cultural institution, to include any healer of any traditional society, it produces a false uniformity between these cultures and creates the misleading idea of the existence of a religion before all others. Others accuse them of being unable to recognize the commonalities between the various traditional societies.\n\nShamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces and spirits of parallel dimensions that coexist simultaneously with ours, affecting all the manifestations of life. In contrast to animism, in which every member of society involved the practice, shamanism requires specialized knowledge or skills.\n\nThere are many variations of shamanism in the world; the following are shared by all forms of shamanism beliefs: 1 -there clarify that comes from shamanism \"shaman\", who is typical of eastern Siberia, though, as Mircea Eliade notes in his attempt to make a general history shamanism, there are a variety of shamans scattered around the world, and characterizes them being medical and spiritual guides.\n\nShamanism is based on the premise that the visible world is pervaded by invisible forces or spirits that affect the lives of the living. Unlike organized religions such as animism or animatism that are led by pastors and that all members of a society practice, shamanism requires individualized knowledge and special abilities. Shamans act outside established religions, and traditionally act alone. Shamans can come together in associations, as have practitioners Tantric Indians.\n\nAccording to Kehoe, Eliade Shamanism is an invention synthesized from various sources unsupported by any direct research. Believes that what he and other scholars define as characteristic of shamanism, trances, chants, communication with spirits, cures, are practices that exist in shamanic cultures do not like some Judeo-Christian rituals. In your opinion, they are typical of many cultures that use them, and you can not include in a religion -call shamanism. Therefore, it rejects that shamanism is an ancient surviving religion of Palaeolithic.\n\nThis may not only reveal the visions animist hiding behind shamanism, but also express their relevance to the recent world where ecological problems do paradigms valid balance and protection. Just as shamanism itself, music and songs related to it in various cultures are diverse, far from being similar. In some cultures and in some cases, some songs related to shamanism also try to imitate natural sounds, sometimes through onomatopoeia.\n\nShamanism is considered by some to be the history of all organized religions, since it was born before the Neolithic. The pagan Greek was influenced by shamanism, as reflected in the stories of Tantalus, Prometheus, Medea and Calipso among others, as well as the mysteries, like those of Eleusis. Some of the shamanic practices of the Greek religion were copied later by religion of Romans.\n\nToday, shamanism survives mainly in indigenous peoples. His practice continues in the tundras, jungles, deserts and other rural areas, and also in cities, towns, suburbs, and villages around the world. It is particularly widespread in Africa, and also in South America, where there is called \"shamanism mestizo \".\n\nAlthough shamanism had a great tradition in Europe before the advent of monotheism, remained as a traditional organized religion only in Mari-El and Udmurtia, two semi-autonomous provinces of Russia. Siberia is a center of shamanism, inhabited by many different peoples. Many of the people who populate the Urals and Altai, have maintained these practices alive until modern times. Many of the ethnographic sources have been collected from people. Many groups of hunters and breeders of reindeer practiced shamanism as a living tradition also in modern times, especially those who have lived isolated until recent times as naganasan.\n\nShamanism is still practiced in South Korea, where the role of women represent shaman calls mudang, while few men are known as baksoo mudang. Both are usually members of lower classes. There is a great influence on the shamanic religion of Bon central Asia, and in Buddhism Tibetan ; Buddhism became popular among Tibetan shamans, Mongols, and Manchus in the early eighth century.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!",

      "description": "Free video about volcanic rocks. This video was created for you by http://epsos.de and can be re-used for free under the creative commons license with the attribution of epSos.de as the original author of this volcanic rocks video.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!\n\nThe volcanic rocks or extrusive are those igneous rock that formed by cooling wash in the Earth's surface or magma. The rapid cooling of magma or lava turns into volcanic rock makes many small crystals are formed, also called microcrystals or fine grains in these rocks. Rapid cooling may also be full or partially composed of volcanic rocks glass. The most common volcanic rocks on Earth are the basalt followed by the andesite. Other volcanic rocks are rhyolite, the dacite and traquita to name a few.\n\nVolcanic rocks can be divided into those with no crystals visible to the naked eye, ie they have texture aphanitic, and those crystals visible to the naked eye, ie texture phaneritic. When large crystals, highlighting in the array is called porphyritic texture or porphyritic.\n\nThe differentiation of the magma from which the volcanic rocks produces its chemical composition can gradually vary in their ascent to the surface, resulting in different volcanic rocks. In turn, the inicales differences in composition of magmas, the assimilation of host rocks, or magma mixing, result in these differentiation processes follow different trends.\n\nIf cooling occurs slowly subsurface rocks form with crystals large referred plutonic rocks or intrusive, whereas if cooling occurs rapidly on the surface, for example, after eruption, rocks formed with invisible crystals known as rocks volcanic or extrusive. Most of the 700 types of igneous rocks that have been described are formed on the surface of the crust. Examples of igneous rocks are the diorite, the rhyolite, the porphyry, the gabbro, the basalt and granite.\n\nIgneous rocks make up approximately ninety-five percent of the top of the crust, but are hidden by a relatively thin layer but extensive sedimentary and metamorphic. Its minerals, and global chemical provide information on the composition of Earth's mantle, which comes magma originates igneous rocks, and temperature and pressure conditions prevailing when the rock was formed, or pre-existing rock that is melted.\n\nThe Lava is magma during its ascent through the crust, reaches the surface. When it surfaces, lava usually has temperatures ranging between 700 ° C and 1200 ° C. Unlike the magma cools slowly deep underground. Volcanoes are the first group formed by the eruption of lava and can be of many types, from smooth basalt volcanoes and surface slopes stepped up ash and lava cones typical andesite and rhyolite. Volcanoes can form boiler if the dome collapses inward, forming a crater. These characteristics often form lakes in it, then forming the lava in an island that is the new cone.\n\nThe lava domes are a mass of lava whose viscosity prevents you descend the flanks of the volcano and that accumulates on top of the chimney supply. The edges of the domes generally have very steep flanks and often are in unstable areas.\n\nThe volcanic lava tubes or pipes are tunnels formed inside lava flows as it flows. The surface of the melt on contact with the air (which is much colder) solidifies creating an excellent thermal insulator for molten lava flow to maintain the temperature in the basement. This is a very common mechanism in most basaltic flows, and allows the lava reach long distances, even to drain into the sea only by having fluid inside the tube.\n\nIn exceptional cases, a volcanic cone can be filled without lava erupt. The lava fills the caldera is known as a lava lake. Lava lakes do not usually last long, either return to the magma chamber once the pressure decreases or in erupting lava or pyroclastic eruptions.\n\nThe rocks formed by lava of different volcanoes, differ greatly in appearance and composition. If a wash rhyolitic cooled quickly, it can become obsidian. If left with bubbles of gas, the same lava can form pumice. Instead, slowly cooling, forms the rhyolite.\n\nThe rock is then placed in its field petrographic by calculating the standard. Indeed the classification of igneous rocks is based on the presence and exclusion of major minerals, we must reconstruct the mineralogy of the rock as if it had fully crystallized. For example if we take a tholeiitic basalt, which is part of the rocks supersaturated silica, we never meet again porphyritic quartz in rock since silica tends to stay in the mesostasis, it is only with the calculation of the standard which shows virtual minerals that we can correctly determine the rock.\n\nThank you for supporting the creative commons movement !!",

Not only has the goat managed to steal the tiger's heart, he has also muscled in on his bed, forcing the tiger to sleep on the roof of his shelter instead. Astonished keepers decided to name the goat Timur - meaning iron - in honour of its bravery.",

Rain is the main factor in the video there were some gust that pushed my truck towards the other lane coming across the Galveston Bay bridge.  The Gulf of Mexico was very rough and to my surprise and their stupidity there were people surfing or let's say standing in the water holding unto a surfboard.  The waves were not the surfing type at all.  They were setting themselves up for rip currents.",

By early Sunday, it was a tropical depression with top sustained winds of 20 mph located about 20 miles southeast of Hot Springs, Ark.\r\n\r\nWhile Rita didn't match the destructive power of Hurricane Katrina, it still left a massive trail of destruction in Texas and Louisiana. \r\n\r\nThe storm caused \"tens of millions of dollars\" in structural damage in the Houston area alone, Harris County Tax Collector-Assessor Paul Bettencourt estimated.\r\n\r\nStill some residents are anxious to return to their homes.\r\n\r\nTexas officials set up regions that would reopen to evacuees on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, and Texas Governor Rick Perry urged Houston residents to respect the schedule laid out for an \"orderly migration.\"\r\n\r\nCommercial airline service to the city also resumed Sunday; many flights in were booked.\r\n\r\nHouston Mayor Bill White, wanting to avoid the gridlock that occurred as people fled from Rita, asked gas station attendants, convenience store clerks and grocery store workers to come back quickly. \"There is some fuel available in tankers, but they can't deliver it if you're not there,\" he said.\r\n\r\nIn some areas of Houston, workers heeded the mayor's advice returning to work at convenience stores and gas stations. \r\n\r\nKEYWORD - HURRICANE RITA\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/16addfa3b48822e3559776610f7365f0 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

You know, it''s not a good feeling, I can tell you that. But like I said, now that we know, we know where we''ve got to go, what we''ve got to do. So, we''ll make it.\"\r\n12.

SOUNDBITE: (English) Judge Ronnie McDonald, Bastrop County official:\r\n\"The weather has changed the last two days to give us a better opportunity to fight. Now, we''re gearing up for the weather to change again. So the firefighters are going in and trying to make sure that we are drawing and digging our lines, and making sure the fire is not spreading.\"\r\n14. Close pan of structure loss sheets\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs fire crews gain ground against one of the most destructive wildfires in Texas history, some residents of Bastrop county, who lost their houses to the flames, were gearing up on Wednesday to rebuild their homes.\r\nThe blaze has left at least two people dead, blackened about 45 square miles (116.55 square kilometres) around Bastrop and cast a haze over Austin, 25 miles (40 kilometres) to the west. \r\nThe state reports the number of homes lost has reached almost 800. An elite team is searching the smoking ruins to see if there are more victims.\r\n\"Well, you know kind of lost in space, I guess,\" said Lance Fosdick, who lost his home in the wildfires. \"Just wandering around waiting for something to happen. You know, it''s not a good feeling, I can tell you that.\"\r\nFirefighters report that the flames are at least 30 percent contained after burning uncontrolled for three days.\r\n\"The weather has changed the last two days to give us a better opportunity to fight. Now, we''re gearing up for the weather to change again. So the firefighters are going in and trying to make sure that we are drawing and digging our lines, and making sure the fire is not spreading,\"said Bastrop County Judge Ronnie McDonald. \r\nLocal officials credit an easing of the winds from Tropical Storm Lee that had caused the fire to explode over the weekend. \r\nStill, thousands of Texans have been evacuated from Central Texas and forced to put their lives on hold, as they wait find out if their homes are still standing.\r\n\"Our house is not on the list. But, we know that it wasn''t good,\" said Bill Kruger. He and his wife lost their home in the wildfires.\r\n\"We''ve got friends that were trying to put out hot spots and they''ve confirmed it, that there''s nothing there,\" said Kruger. \"It''s sad. It''s sad for everyone. I don''t feel sorry just for for myself. I feel sorry for everybody that this has happened to.\"\r\nIn addition to the two victims in the Bastrop area fire whose bodies were found Tuesday, the outbreak is blamed for two deaths elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/292834bdc05124d1a36e462e13345476 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "The following is a time-lapse video created over 104 days of the 2015 flood of Lake Texoma. This was filmed at Lighthouse Resort and Marina. On the 7th of May 2015, it started raining at Lake Texoma. At the time, the lake elevation was ~612' MSL, or about 3' below normal. It kept raining and raining. We saw the lake rise over 34' in less than 3 weeks.   Prior to this year, Lake Texoma has gone over the spillway (640' MSL) just 3 times since 1944... 1957, 1990, and again in 2007. This year (2015) we went over the spillway twice. We also broke the record for the highest lake elevation in history, which was 645.66 on the 1st of June 2015. Shortly thereafter the lake started to recede and we were on our way to recovery... we thought. Then Tropical Storm Bill headed our way from the Gulf of Mexico. It dumped torrential rain across our entire watershed. Lake Texoma began to rise again, and this time quickly. Some days the lake would come up over 2' in one day. That's a lot of water if you consider the size of Texoma, which is about 139 sq miles. We crested again on the 22nd of June after all the rains from T.D. Bill made its way into the lake. Finally, July and August weather cleared up and the lake worked its way back down to normal. As you can see in the video, the traffic on the lake significantly picks up as the water gets below 620' MSL. Thanks for watching, support Lake Texoma!",

      "description": "To use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@storyful.com\n\nThursday, June 18, 2015\n\n“Lake Fire” - San Bernardino National Forest. Near Angelus Oaks, California -- Approximately 70 miles east of Los Angeles.\n\nJenks Lake is near Angelus Oaks, CA and is only a short distance from the fire. Sikorsky Air Crane and Huey helicopters coordinated their water pick-ups in a precise air traffic pattern.\n\nThis footage was taken with a camera placed on the shore of the lake. I didn't want my presence to interfere with their operations or distract the flight crews. To do this, I placed my camera at the edge of the lake and would scramble up the steep hillside between arrivals. The intense rotor wash from the Sikorsky Air Crane helicopters blew away large amounts of water, sending a windy mist in every direction. My equipment was soaked -- the blurriness you see in the video is caused by water on the lens. It was an incredible experience!\n\nSeveral days after filming this, air crews spotted commercially-available drones in the area. The incidents received a great deal of press attention, and brought to light important issues regarding public usage of drones.\n\nI'm a freelance photographer based in Rancho Cucamonga, CA. You can view more of my work here:\n\nwww.EricRosenwaldPhotography.com\n\nThe equipment I used to get these shots:\nhttp://roxant.com/stabilizer/\nhttp://store.apple.com/us/buy-iphone/iphone6\nhttp://www.olloclip.com/product/iphone6-telephoto-wide-angle-cpl/\nhttp://www.shoulderpod.com\nhttp://www.rode.com/microphones/videomicgo",

Right now we're in the town of Running Springs; we're at the southern tip of Running Springs. It appears at this point that the worse of the fire has pushed through but as you can see we still have a lot of active fire.\"\r\n13. Various of firefighters battling fire\r\n14. Various charred vehicle\r\n15. Mid of burned barbecue grill\r\n16. Charred car with small fire still burning in the foreground\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs fires continue to rage throughout Southern California, officials in Running Springs say fire destroyed at least 1-hundred homes, leaving many residents uncertain about their future.\r\nFour years ago, fire destroyed hundreds of homes in nearby Lake Arrowhead and also affected Running Springs.\r\nResidents of the mountain resort community east of Los Angeles were evacuated last night to Highland, a town near San Bernadino.\r\nAbout a dozen people turned a Walmart parking lot into a makeshift shelter, with the superstore giving out food and water to evacuees.\r\nDespite the devastation, many vow to rebuild.\r\n\"This is our very first house. We've been married 27 years, our first house, and this is how we are. We won't give it up, we'll stay,\" local Theresa Alamo told AP Television.\r\n\"When you live in the mountains, you put up with the danger of the fire because it's a small price or small trade for very little crime, very good neighbours, being able to live and raise your children where you want,\" another local evacuee, Gary Garrison, said.\r\nBy day three, the dozen wildfires had burned more than 1,300 homes and businesses in Southern California, and the destruction may only be the start for the region. \r\nAt least 346-thousand homes, roughly one in three, according to census data, were evacuated in San Diego County alone, sheriff's officials said. \r\nBut the total number could be much higher, and state officials were still struggling to estimate how many people had fled.\r\nSince they began on Sunday, the fires have burned at least 373,000 acres, or 583 square miles (1,510 sq. kilometres). \r\nFully a quarter of the California coast was ablaze. \r\nFlames climbed halfway toward the Nevada line, chewing through chunks of seven counties and devastating numerous communities.\r\nAs the fires spread, most out of control, smaller blazes were merging into larger, more fearsome ones. \r\nEvacuations were being announced in one community after another as firefighters found themselves overwhelmed by gale-force Santa Ana winds, some gusting to 70 miles per hour (113 kilometres per hour).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/19557310e0668bbe0eb3eb4dee4164f1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

As an outlet for what he describes as his desire to be involved in public service, where he turned to the park district.\n\nMaple Street Park is always very quiet on any weekday. It is a great place to take walks and exercise as well if you like quiet settings.\n\nStringer Media was glad to film this park as a part of our park reviews. \n\nRating: On a scale of 1-10 We give this park a 9 for it's quietness and no visual evidence of crime. There are no permanent restrooms. They are all portable. But they were very clean. It gets a 5 for it's unhealthy grass as I am sure that is probably due to a lot of soccer activity. There is drinking water available and lighting. No tables for picnics.",

      "description": "A car went up in flames in the parking lot of the Vista Sunrise Apartments in Palm Springs, California, in the early morning (around 2:40 a.m.) November 5th, 2015.  There are no known injuries or immediate visible damage to other cars or even the covered parking, as the car had been moved out into an open area.  Apparently one of the neighbors likes working on his car in the middle of this area of the parking lot at night, and he was working on the car when it caught fire.  Nicholas Snow, who happens to be a journalist, resides in the complex, and from his second floor bedroom about 250 feet into the complex heard, \"Someone call 911,\" which he did before throwing on clothes to shoot this video.  Visit www.NicholasSnow.com for more about the reporter.",

      "description": "Tile Roof Fontana CA, Call (626) 784-1100 SD Young's Roofing\n\nConsidering a tile roof? As you may know the roof is the most important part of a building. There are many types of roofs for all types of climate and geographical conditions. Whatever the type or size or structure of the roof, as a roof system forms a very important part of a building. It not only protects the building against the weather and other conditions but also adds to the style and beauty of the house. Tile roofing is favoured by most people, as tiles are available in different colours and textures and is also easy to replace or repair.\nTile roof repair or tile roof replacement can be easily done whether you have a flat roof or a sloping roof. Its material can be ceramic or concrete cement. They are actually clay which is fired at a very high temperature. Sometimes cement concrete is added or cellulose is added to produce light or heavy type of tile roofing. Most people don't think of it as a clay roof.\nTile roofing is available in different type of colours and you could initiate a change in your house or your office by going for a tile roof replacement. You may be considering a color change from brown to charcoal or a brown blend. It not only gives your home or office a new outlook altogether but also protects your building from the snow, the rain, the heat etc.\nAnother advantage is that it allows more air circulation and keeps you cool during the hot summer season. They are also non combustible and provide you protection against fire. Tile roof replacement can be easily done and it is cost effective too. Tile roof repair involved hardly an hour and can be easily done by any worker.\nThis can also be done as an added protection from severe heat and cold. In some countries, either the heat is unbearable or the cold. This roofing would not only give the building a new look, but also protect you from the unbearable heat or cold and acts like a filter. Tile roof repair can be easily done instead of generic tile replacement if it is just a small crack thereby saving you money and time. You can mix some mortar and fill in your crack and just coat it with the tile colour paint from a list of colours that are available.\nIf you have a damaged roof or if you wish to give a new look to your home or office, and then it is the best option. The best provision for protecting your home from those leaks and cracks on your roof is to provide such roofing which would not only protect your building but also provide a long lasting solution for your home. Both heat and cold can be regulated with the help of tile roofing thereby reducing your heating and cooling bills.\nAs we all are aware that there are different tile roofing according to the climate and geographical conditions. Therefore if you are considering a tile roof getting expert advice in maintaining a roof can prove to be very helpful. For complete detailed information you can give us a call for an estimate or for any questions that you might have.\nPlease share this video: https://youtu.be/K7Kl4veih2M\n\nhttp://ezinearticles.com/?Exceptional-Features-of-Tile-Roofing&id=6620380",

      "description": "Time-lapse video of the geomagnetic storm which reached earth early this morning, shot from California over the lights of Minden/Gardnerville, Nevada.  I went south to the Coleville/Walker area, mostly to get away from smoke form the 17,000-acre Washington fire. It would be more productive to move north, closer to the aurora, and east, further from city lights. The forecast for the next 3 nights indicates another solar storm: https://www.facebook.com/AuroraAlerts?fref=ts\nTonight and especially tomorrow night are the best of the three nights. The best (dark) viewing hours will get shorter and shorter each night as the moon stays up closer and closer to the oncoming light of morning twilight, around 3:40 am. \n\nGet away from city lights and look directly north. The aurora borealis may be happening 600 or more miles north, but 65 miles high, so look on the horizon from a place with a low horizon north, like a mountain top or large dry lake bed. (The Black Rock Desert for example would be a good place to view an aurora from.)",

Wide of crowd\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nA key political alliance on Wednesday announced a series of fresh street protests to demand national elections be postponed, as tens of thousands of troops fanned out across Bangladesh ahead of the January 22 polls.\r\nSheikh Hasina, leader of a 19-party alliance, told a huge rally in the heart of the nation's capital that it would start non-stop demonstrations\r\naround the presidential palace on January 14 and, enforce a nationwide blockade on January 14-15 and another on January 17-18 to force its demands.\r\nHasina accused the country's interim President Iajuddin Ahmed of bias toward former Prime Minister Khaleda Zia, Hasina's archrival.\r\nShe asked Ahmed \"not to be the part of a conspiracy\" to rig the polls.\r\nThe latest protest plans came after a three-day nationwide transport blockade that ended on Tuesday and saw violent clashes between police and\r\ndemonstrators who want the polls postponed, citing alleged flaws in the voter list and other problems.\r\nOn Wednesday, about 60-thousand troops began spreading across the country to perform election duties and an Interior Ministry statement said the army had been empowered to make arrests without warrants anywhere, to ensure security during elections. \r\nBangladesh has spent 15 years under military rule since gaining independence from Pakistan in 1971. \r\nTwo of its presidents have been slain in military coups, and there have been 19 failed coup attempts.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/bf5285632c84c0eea9a782a8f18b01e3 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

They had taken shelter at ModdhoMazer Para of Shapori Dip area. They had entered Bangladesh illegally on June 10.\"\r\nMyanmar considers Rohingyas to be illegal immigrants from Bangladesh and denies them citizenship. \r\nBangladesh says Rohingyas have been living in Myanmar for centuries and should be recognised there as citizens.\r\nBangladeshi Foreign Minister Dipu Moni said on Tuesday that the impoverished country's resources already are strained.\r\nThe UN's refugee agency estimates that 800-thousand Rohingyas live in Myanmar's mountainous Rakhine state. \r\nThousands attempt to flee every year to Bangladesh, Malaysia and elsewhere.\r\nUN officials said on Friday that the agency was in contact with the Bangladesh government and hopes it will give the Rohingya refuge.\r\nThey said Myanmar officials estimate up to 30-thousand people could be fleeing the violence that has claimed several lives in recent days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/43bf1cc0a630010e490aa0f47fa0473d \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various of people outside their tents\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nAmid concerns about a possible disaster, Myanmar state television said on Monday that thousands of people displaced by communal violence last year have been evacuated from makeshift camps to safer ground ahead of a cyclone expected later this week.\r\nAround 140-thousand people - mostly Rohingya - have been living in flimsy tents and makeshift shelters in the region after two outbreaks of Buddhist-Muslim violence there last year, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.\r\nThe report said authorities had moved 5,158 people from low-lying camps in the Rakhine state capital, Sittwe, to safer shelter. \r\nAhead of the move, discussions over where to locate the Rohingya had been complicated by widespread anti-Muslim sentiment, which still runs high nearly a year after unrest between the areas ethnic Rakhine Buddhists and the Rohingya erupted in June 2012.\r\nThe violence has largely segregated Rakhine state along religious lines, with prominent Buddhists - including monks - urging people to boycott Muslim businesses. \r\nTens of thousands of Rohingya have been confined to cramped camps, their movement heavily restricted. \r\nUnable to go home, most cannot work or attend school.\r\n\"The place that they want us to move to is at the edge of the village and there is no protection for us. That place is very dangerous and frightening to stay. In case of a cyclone that place can be flooded. Everything can be flooded,\" said 42-year-old Khin Khin Thant ahead of the move.\r\nAccording to the report, displaced people were also moved in 10 other townships in western Myanmar. \r\nIt did not give the number of people evacuated in those locations.\r\nThe United Nations estimates that nearly 70-thousand of those displaced are in low-lying areas along the coast that are highly susceptible to tidal surges and flooding.\r\nIn 2008, Cyclone Nargis killed more than 130-thousand people in Myanmar.\r\nCyclone Mahasen is expected to hit neighbouring Bangladesh on Thursday or Friday. \r\nSpillover rain could cause landslides and flooding in Myanmar.\r\nAid groups have issued warnings for weeks that annual monsoon rains could wreak havoc for displaced people in their camps and spark disease outbreaks.\r\n\"The government has been repeatedly warned to make appropriate arrangements for those displaced in Rakhine state. Now thousands of lives are at stake unless targeted action is taken immediately to assist those most at risk,\" Isabelle Arradon, Amnesty International's deputy Asia Pacific director, said in a statement on Monday.\r\nThe Rohingya have suffered discrimination for decades. \r\nLong viewed as illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, most are denied citizenship despite the fact that many have lived in Myanmar for generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/d52f8421b8cb96817764ab234ff4f5bd \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Arias listening\r\nSTORYLINE\r\nThe presidents of five Central American countries met on Wednesday in the Costa Rica capital San Jose to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the Esquipulas II Peace Plan, which put an end to the civil wars that tore through the region two decades ago.\r\nCosta Rican President Oscar Arias hosted the event, along with his counterparts Martin Torrijos (Panama), Oscar Berger (Guatemala), Manuel Zelaya (Honduras) and Antonio Saca (El Salvador).  \r\nThe presidents remembered the anniversary of the peace plan which allowed the beginning of negotiations to end the bloody military conflicts in Nicaragua, El Salvador and Guatemala that left over 300,000 dead.\r\nThe peace plan, which was named after the Guatemalan city of Esquipulas, comprised three basic principles: the end of the wars, a commitment to democracy and free elections, and economic development.\r\nArias, who was president at the time the agreement was signed, emphasised the importance of the peace plan.\r\n\"We do not come to celebrate the annihilation of the enemy nor the destruction of a rival. This is not a commemoration of victory in the battlefield because in Central America no-one won the war. We beat the war,\" he said.\r\nNicaraguan president Daniel Ortega was the only leader from the region not to attend Wednesday's meeting.\r\nArias and Ortega have remained distant in recent years and have not met since Ortega assumed power in Nicaragua in January of this year.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/34e7aa0711e8c0b9e962b29858194d21 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The smaller cages are being renovated and are being made bigger. The park is cleaned daily. The animals are fed every day. The park has a nutritionist, a veterinarian and biologists,\" he said.\r\nFundazoo also said they worry about the health of the animals since Simon Bolivar and the Conservation Centre are the only ones that have an animal nutritionist and \r\na veterinarian specialised in forest species.\r\nCosta Rica banned circuses with animals in 2002 and has also barred sport hunting. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/fee02d83a761d66007aa95e1495dae0e \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "T/I 10:16:15\r\nPROGRESS THREATENS TO DESTROY THE PYRAMIDS\r\nCairo, Egypt                Natsot            Duration: 2.34\"\r\nThe Great Pyramids of Giza have weathered 46 centuries; of wars, earthquakes, floods, and dust storms, but the 47th century is\r\nlooking like being one of their worst. The pyramids are in the pathway of man-made \"progress\". Built in the desert, they are now flanked by Cairo's outer suburbs, and haphazardly, and often illegally, built apartment houses are blocking the pyramids from view. Tourist shops sprawl to within a few hundred metres of the Sphinx, which shares the limestone plateau at Giza with the pyramids. A factory with chimney stacks that belch black smoke, a military barracks and a housing complex\r\nfor 15,000 people crowd the monuments. Some of the colossal limestone blocks of the three pyramids have crumbled away, eroded by pollution. The pyramids are on UNESCO's list of protected world heritage sites, but that status has failed to halt the pollution, or the growth of the urban sprawl around the monuments. And it couldn't prevent the construction of an eight-lane ring road around Cairo, part of which is only 2.5 kilometres from the pyramids. Dr. Zahi Hawas, Head of Archeological excavations at the pyramids, predicts a rush to build along the ring road, more pollution, overcrowding, and traffic around the pyramids. Recent public awareness of the threat of the ring road, and pressure from UNESCO, have brought a temporary stop but it appears that it has not been quite enough.\r\nSHOWS: \r\nGiza pyramids. VS of Nazlet El Seman, a town nudging pyramids. New construction encroaching on sphinx. Cranes at building site, Giza pyramid behind. Rubbish dump in front of pyramids. Beer cans at dump. Burning rubbish, pyramid glimpsed through smoke. Partly completed elevated area of ring road. Trucks on ring road. Archeological dig with pyramids behind. Workers at archeological excavation site. Freshly discovered tombs at site. Dr. Zahi Hawas, SOT: \"The ring road will kill the pyramids, particularly inviting more building in area, also bringing more pollution. The planned road defies UNESCO rules on protecting the pyramids\". VS of urban sprawl. Nile delta villages and pyramids.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/396d36a37da2bdd83b7775d352f56978 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The claim couldn''t be independently verified.\r\nGovernment troops have been fighting rebels in the area for months. The town is a major obstacle in the path from the nearby city of Misrata trying to make their way to Tripoli.\r\nNATO has maintained a bombing campaign on Gadhafi military targets after instituting a no-fly zone decision in March.\r\nThe coalition said it took out four military facilities and a surface-to-air missile in Tripoli, as well as a command centre, two armoured vehicles and five tanks on Thursday in Zawiya.\r\nThe alliance also said NATO warplanes sunk a tugboat carrying troops loyal to Moammar Gadhafi away from Zawiya on Wednesday.    \r\nAn officer at NATO''s operational headquarters in Naples, Italy, said a rescue attempt was made after aircraft spotted several survivors of the sinking swimming toward a nearby buoy. The officer could not be identified under standing rules.\r\nThe rebels claimed on Thursday they had captured the 120,000-barrel-per-day refinery in fighting that could be a turning point in the six-month civil war between Gadhafi and forces seeking to oust him.\r\nThe flow of crude to the refinery from fields in the southwest of Libya had largely been halted since midsummer and its capture was unlikely to have a major impact on Gadhafi''s ability to secure fuel, but it was seen as a significant step in the rebel advance toward the capital.\r\nZawiya was one of the first cities to rise up against the Gadhafi regime when the Libyan revolt began in mid-February on the heels of the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/a3276eced1858841f60a9b0233c186a1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "STORYLINE:\r\nArab League chief Nabil Elaraby said on Tuesday that the massacres taking place in Syria \"amount to war crimes under international law\".\r\nElaraby made the comments during a meeting with the Bulgarian Foreign Minister, Nickolai Mladenov, at the League's headquarters in the Egyptian capital, Cairo.\r\nElaraby spoke particularly of Aleppo, from where 200-thousand Syrians have fled over the past 10 days as the government trains its mortars, tank and helicopter gunships on neighbourhoods seized by the rebels.\r\nThe battle for Aleppo, Syria's commercial hub with around 3 million inhabitants, has now lasted longer than the rebel assault on the capital Damascus that regime troops crushed earlier in July.\r\nOnce a bastion of support for Assad, Aleppo is critical for both the regime and the opposition. Its fall would give the opposition a major strategic victory with a stronghold in the north. A rebel defeat, at the very least, would buy Assad more time.\r\nDespite pledges by the government and opposition to implement the six-point peace plan for Syria brokered by Kofi Annan, a cease-fire never happened, and fighting has continued to escalate to a point where the conflict was recently declared a civil war. \r\nFor many diplomats and military experts, Annan's plan is all but dead.\r\nBulgarian Foreign Minister, Nickolai Mladenov, on Tuesday called on Syrian opposition groups to unify and agree on a leadership in preparation for a post-Assad Syria.\r\n\"I hope that we can see our friends in the Syria opposition organise more quickly to implement what under the auspices of the Arab league that they have achieved,\" Mladenov said. \"This is the National Compact and the transition plan, because this will send a strong message to the people in Syria about the future of their country after the end of the Assad regime,\" he added. \r\nParticipants at a meeting of opposition groups in Cairo earlier this month (July) did agree on fundamental principles for a post-Assad Syria and a general outline to guide the opposition through a transitional period - but scuffles and fistfights during the session and a walkout by a Syrian Kurdish group visibly demonstrated the opposition's disarray.\r\nThe fighting in Aleppo stretched into its 11th day on Tuesday. \r\nDespite regime claims of success and repeated forays by tanks and ground forces into rebel-controlled areas in the northeast and southwest of the city, the rebels appear to have held their ground,\r\nprompting government forces to resort to more shelling by artillery and mortars. Rebel positions are also being attacked with helicopter gunships.\r\nThe Syrian government has defended its assault on Aleppo to the U.N., describing a city in the grip of \"terrorist mercenaries\" funded by Qatar, Saudi Arabia and Turkey, that are holding people hostage as human shields and committing \"horrifying crimes.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/44e510ccd711a728a17f1975bce7b218 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Pushed by howling, erratic winds, a massive wildfire in the north-central part of the US state of Washington was growing rapidly and burning in new directions on Saturday.\r\nRoad closures and evacuations were changing rapidly, as hot weather and winds with gusts up to 30 miles per hour (48 kilometres per hour) were\r\npushing the fire over ridge tops and toward a cluster of small towns northeast of Seattle.\r\nOfficials said there were no reports of injuries and only one more home was destroyed overnight by the lightning-caused wildfire.\r\nThe fire has blackened hillsides, destroyed homes and downed power lines. \r\nMany towns were without electrical power or phone service on Saturday.\r\nThe lightning-caused fire had scorched nearly 340 square miles (880 square kilometres) in the scenic Methow Valley. \r\nThe fire was measured at 260 square miles (673 square kilometres) on Friday.\r\nThe fire consumed utility poles from two major power lines, knocking out power.\r\nVic Stokes, a rancher who lives in Twisp, a town in Methow Valley northeast of Seattle, said the local residents put out some of the spot fires themselves since Thursday, getting little sleep.\r\nBy Saturday, a fire had jumped to a nearby creek bed. \r\nStokes, his son and his daughter-in-law spent the morning clearing brush. \r\n\"Anything that hasn't burned has a chance of burning yet,\" Stokes said.\r\nSo far, his home is intact, but he's lost hay and a barn and is worried for livestock he had grazing in an area that's now scorched.\r\n\"We need to get up there and see what we can find that's alive. We know we've lost cattle,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/b65b6fb9517c5a30a8c956d997592ccc \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "08/14/2015 lightning started fires in Chelan, WA. On 08/15 the Yacht Club was evacuated and by 08/19/15 the fire moved very close to the Yacht Club Villa with 100 homes. New Fire lines were cut and old ones were cleared and widened. Many retardant drops were made above the homes and firefighters spent 24 hours a day keeping watch on our property. In the early hours of 08/20/15 the fire exploded and it looked like our homes would be gone. Firefighters stationed themselves throughout the Villa and watered things down to help keep our property safe. The fire stopped right where the fire line was made and where retardant was dropped. The fire moved its way north. Without all the firefighters and National Guard we would have lost all 100 homes.  The club members and other area residents began serving evening meals to all the fire crews as they changed shifts. As many as 180 firefighters have been fed each evening to thank them for saving our homes and working to get this fire out. The dinners were served for a week starting 08/23/2015.  THANK YOU ALL FIREFIGHTERS !!!\nThanks to The Coleman Brothers for recording the song and Thank You to Judy Kellersberger and Mike Black for writing this great song!!!",

      "description": "Ijen volcano has a one-kilometer-wide turquoise-colored acidic crater lake. The lake is the site of a labor-intensive sulfur mining operation, in which sulfur-laden baskets are carried by hand from the crater floor. The work is paid well considering the cost of living in the area, but is very onerous. Workers earn around Rp 50,000 - 75,000 ($4 to $5.4) per day and once out of the crater, still need to carry their loads of sulfur chunks about three kilometers to the nearby Paltuding Valley to get paid.\n\nIn addition, the electric-blue flame of Ijen phenomenon has occurred for a long time, but beforehand there was no midnight hiking. A two-hour hike is required to reach the rim of the crater, followed by a 45-minute hike down to the bank of the crater. The blue fire is ignited sulphuric gas, which emerges from cracks at temperatures up to 600 degrees Celsius (1,112 degrees Fahrenheit).\n\nThe Ijen volcano itself is part of the Ijen volcano complex, a group of stratovolcanoes in East Java, Indonesia. It is inside a larger caldera Ijen, which is about 20 kilometers wide. The Gunung Merapi stratovolcano is the highest point of that complex. The name \"Gunung Merapi\" means \"mountain of fire\" in the Indonesian language.",

      "description": "On my way home after photographing monsoon thunderstorms northeast of Flagstaff, I noticed smoke rising over the hills along Townsend-Winona Road. I thought it might be another tree fire, but as I rounded a bend, it turned out to be a terrible house fire. Checking radar, it looked like there were 3 lightning strikes over that location from 2:45-3:00 PM and FlagScanner now reports that neighbors \"heard a very large thunderclap along with lightning right before the fire started.\" Several fire trucks were on the scene but the fire was intense and they had to work hard to control it. Unfortunately, it looks like the house was a total loss. \n\nhttp://flagscanner.com/fsmajor-fully-involved-house-fire-foster-road/",

      "description": "A difficult hike along the entire Black Mountain Crest Trail starting at Bowlens Creek and ascending 3,000+ ft to Horse Rock Meadows below Celo Knob. From there the trail roller coasters over 4 of the tallest summits in NC before terminating at Mt Mitchell, the tallest peak east of the Mississippi River. This was performed as a shuttle hike. It is ~12.5 mi and ~5,500 ft elevation gain. The trail starts in Pisgah National Forest and ends in Mt Mitchell State Park, traversing the crest of the Black Mountains crossing Winter Star Mt, Potato Hill, Balsam Cone, Big Tom, Mt Craig, and Mt Mitchell. Thanks to Mike and Joyce for driving me back down the mountain to my car!",

Firefighters clearing brush with tools and chainsaws\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nFlames whirled dangerously close to homes on Tuesday as gusty Santa Ana winds sent the biggest of southern California's wildfires flaring in hilly brushlands on Los Angeles' northern edge and along subdivisions to the west.\r\nFirefighters with hoses guarded houses as helicopters unleashed loads of water on hot spots of the more than 20-square-mile (32 square kilometre) blaze charring slopes above the San Fernando Valley communities of Porter Ranch and Granada Hills.\r\nFlames then pushed west to the rolling grasslands of Ventura County and made runs toward Simi Valley neighbourhoods of modern homes defended by a broad firebreak, helicopters, airplanes and ground crews.\r\nThe fire is one of three major blazes that have burned more than 34 square miles (55 square kilometres) of Southern California, destroyed dozens of homes and forced thousands of people to evacuate their homes this week.\r\nOne man died in the flames, and a motorist was killed in a crash as a fire neared a freeway.\r\nSixty-two structures, 15 of them homes, have been destroyed in the Porter Ranch area, said Los Angeles County fire officials. \r\nOfficials said on Tuesday night they did not know how much of the fire was contained.\r\nTen miles away, there was major progress against Los Angeles' other big wildfire.\r\nA blaze bigger than 7 square miles (11 square kilometres) in the northeastern San Fernando Valley was 70 percent contained and some evacuees were allowed to go home. \r\nBut people who lived in an area where 38 mobile homes were destroyed were not permitted to return.\r\nThe outbreak of fires followed the weekend arrival of the first significant Santa Ana winds of the fall.\r\nThe National Weather Service said the intensity of the winds was diminishing but warned there would still be strong gusts. \r\nWarnings for critical fire weather conditions were to remain in effect until Wednesday night.\r\nThe Santa Anas usually sweep in between October and February as cold, dry air descending over the Great Basin flows toward Southern California and squeezes through mountain passes and canyons. \r\nThe extremely low humidity levels, which make vegetation easier to burn, and high windspeeds combine to whip fires into infernos.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/8e2ddc4adb39944eba929a88febdf21f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Various charred vehicle\r\n15. Mid of burned barbecue grill\r\n16. Charred car with small fire still burning in the foreground\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nAs fires continue to rage throughout Southern California, officials in Running Springs say fire destroyed at least 1-hundred homes, leaving many residents uncertain about their future.\r\nFour years ago, fire destroyed hundreds of homes in nearby Lake Arrowhead and also affected Running Springs.\r\nResidents of the mountain resort community east of Los Angeles were evacuated last night to Highland, a town near San Bernadino.\r\nAbout a dozen people turned a Walmart parking lot into a makeshift shelter, with the superstore giving out food and water to evacuees.\r\nDespite the devastation, many vow to rebuild.\r\n\"This is our very first house. We've been married 27 years, our first house, and this is how we are. We won't give it up, we'll stay,\" local Theresa Alamo told AP Television.\r\n\"When you live in the mountains, you put up with the danger of the fire because it's a small price or small trade for very little crime, very good neighbours, being able to live and raise your children where you want,\" another local evacuee, Gary Garrison, said.\r\nBy day three, the dozen wildfires had burned more than 1,300 homes and businesses in Southern California, and the destruction may only be the start for the region. \r\nAt least 346-thousand homes, roughly one in three, according to census data, were evacuated in San Diego County alone, sheriff's officials said. \r\nBut the total number could be much higher, and state officials were still struggling to estimate how many people had fled.\r\nSince they began on Sunday, the fires have burned at least 373,000 acres, or 583 square miles (1,510 sq. kilometres). \r\nFully a quarter of the California coast was ablaze. \r\nFlames climbed halfway toward the Nevada line, chewing through chunks of seven counties and devastating numerous communities.\r\nAs the fires spread, most out of control, smaller blazes were merging into larger, more fearsome ones. \r\nEvacuations were being announced in one community after another as firefighters found themselves overwhelmed by gale-force Santa Ana winds, some gusting to 70 miles per hour (113 kilometres per hour).\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/19557310e0668bbe0eb3eb4dee4164f1 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Wide shot of Marines walking in formation \r\n\r\nSTORYLINE:\r\n\r\nUnits of the British Royal Marines continued their desert combat training in southern California this week.\r\n\r\nSome 560 of the British commandos are guests of the US Marine Corps at their Twentynine Palms Base about 150 miles south of Los Angeles. \r\n\r\nIt's the largest US Marine base and home to their Air-Ground Combat Centre. \r\n\r\nAnd it's where marines come to train for desert warfare, using real bullets and bombs. \r\n\r\nThe Royal Marines are a mix of seasoned veterans, some having served in Afghanistan, and newcomers.\r\n\r\nThe Brits will remain in California for three weeks of what they call \"live-fire training\", using real ammunition and staging mock attacks on enemy positions. \r\n\r\nSome of the Marines of 40 Commando unit say they're too busy focusing on getting the job done to worry about getting hit with a stray bullet. \r\n\r\nTheir commanders say this kind of training gives soldiers the essential feel of battle conditions, without the inconvenience of a real enemy firing back.\r\n\r\nSome of the desert training may also involve the use of tanks, attack helicopters and jet fighters during combined exercises with the US Marines. \r\n\r\nFor now, the Royal Marines are busy fine tuning the skills of small-arms tactics.\r\n\r\nAfter they're finished at Twentynine Palms later this month, they'll head North in another region of California for some high-altitude mountain training, before heading home to Britain sometime in late November.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/f3eed6fd35e83e554b9deeac067a5c2f \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The fire was behind “Smoke N’ Gifts” smoke shop and Enterprise rent-a-car, toward the rear of the building, up in ceiling-roof area next to an arcing flood light. Firefighters quickly knocked down the exterior fire with a hand line before it could take hold in the roof-celing space. Final  extinguishment occurred after Firefighters shut down power to the building. There were no reported injuries, faulty wiring and an overheated parking floodlight seems to be the cause of the evening blaze. - MNR -",

Mark Hargrove, a prison spokesman.\r\nPrisoners pried heavy metal grates from windows to escape and scrambled up and over the dorm roofs to get around 10-foot (3-metre)-tall hurricane fencing intended to keep them from the main exercise yard. \r\nThe fence was installed after a previous riot in 2006.\r\nThe prison was built in 1941 to house 3,000 inmates but held 5,900 men at the time of the riot. \r\nAbout 95 percent of the prisoners are parole violators. \r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/16a265e7a24627268e5914b20c8a1c74 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

Black and white footage of moon's outer crust as taken by cameras on Ebb and Flow \r\nSTORYLINE:\r\nA pair of NASA spacecraft were deliberately crashed into a mountain near the moon's north pole on Monday, ending a mission that peered into the lunar interior.\r\nEngineers commanded the twin spacecraft, Ebb and Flow, to fire their engines and burn their remaining fuel.  \r\nEbb plunged first followed by Flow about 30 seconds later. \r\nAfterward, NASA said it had dedicated the impact site in honour of mission team member, Sally Ride, the first American woman in space who died earlier this year.\r\nBy design, the spot was far away from the Apollo landings and other historical sites. \r\nWith their fuel tanks almost on empty, NASA devised a controlled crash to avoid contacting any of the treasured sites. \r\nSince the crash occurred in the dark, it was not visible from Earth. \r\nThe Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter circling the moon will pass over the mountain and attempt to photograph the skid marks left by the washing machine sized-spacecraft as they hit the surface at 3,800 miles per hour (6,115 kilometres per hour).\r\nAfter rocketing off the launch pad in September 2011, Ebb and Flow took a roundabout journey to the moon, arriving over the New Year's holiday on a gravity-mapping mission. \r\nMore than 100 missions have been flung to Earth's nearest neighbour since the dawn of the Space Age including NASA's six Apollo moon landings that put 12 astronauts on the surface.\r\nEbb and Flow focused exclusively on measuring the moon's lumpy gravity field in a bid to learn more about its interior and early history. \r\nAfter flying in formation for months, they produced the most detailed gravity maps of any body in the solar system.\r\nSecrets long held by the moon are spilling out. \r\nEbb and Flow discovered that the lunar crust is much thinner than scientists had imagined. \r\nAnd it was severely battered by asteroids and comets in the early years of the solar system, more than previously realised.\r\nData so far also appeared to quash the theory that Earth once had two moons that collided and melded into the one we see today.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/0ad44c6266b2799cf3257969792236de \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

      "description": "Paul Walker's daughter sues Porsche for wrongful death\n\nLOS ANGELES - Paul Walker's daughter sued Porsche for wrongful death Monday, claiming the sports car that her father was in when he was killed suffered from numerous design defects.\n\nThe lawsuit filed by Meadow Rain Walker seeks unspecified damages for defects that her lawyers claim kept the actor trapped in the Porsche Carrera GT when it crashed and burst into flames in November 2013.\n\nWalker was on a break from filming the seventh film in the \"Fast & Furious\" franchise when he was killed. He was riding in the Carrera GT driven by friend and business associate Roger Rodas when the car spun out of control, struck three trees and burst into flames on a street in Santa Clarita, California.\n\nThe wrongful-death suit claims the car, which was marketed as a street-legal race car, lacked a proper stability control system and safeguards to protect occupants and keep it from catching fire after a collision.\n\n\"Absent these defects in the Porsche Carrera GT, Paul Walker would be alive today,\" the lawsuit states.\n\nAn email sent to representatives of Porsche Cars North America was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 18-page lawsuit includes a detailed recounting of the crash and contends that the Porsche was traveling 63 to 71 mph (101 to 114 kph) when it spun out of control.\n\nInvestigators concluded the Porsche was going much faster -- up to 94 mph (151 kph) -- when it crashed.\n\nThe investigation by the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department and California Highway Patrol concluded that it was unsafe speed and not mechanical problems that caused the crash. That investigation was aided by engineers from Porsche, who evaluated the wreckage of the rare car.\n\nMeadow Walker's lawsuit contends Porsche didn't include a stability control system in the Carrera GT model Rodas was driving but includes it in other models. It also claims the car lacked proper reinforcements in its doors and used rubber fuel lines that didn't break free to prevent a fire in a crash.\n\nSimilar allegations of design and safety defects were included in a wrongful death lawsuit by Rodas' widow, Kristine Rodas, that remains pending in a federal court in Los Angeles. Rodas was trained as a race car driver and was only driving 55 mph (89 kph), according to his wife's lawsuit. He left behind two young children when he died.\n\nWalker, the star of the \"Fast & Furious\" film franchise, co-owned an auto racing team with Rodas named Always Evolving. Meadow Walker, 16, is the sole heir of his estate.\n\nWalker's two brothers helped complete action scenes in \"Furious 7,\" which earned more than $1.5 billion globally after it was released in April.\n\nSource:http://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/paul-walker-s-daughter-sues-porsche-for-wrongful-death-1.10902917\nhttp://www.tmz.com/2015/09/28/paul-walker-daughter-meadow-sues-porsche-burned-alive-defect/\nhttp://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GRhp5lpd45s",

Explodes at :28 and spent the next five minutes as a glowing, expanding gas cloud radiating down to the surface. It left a blue cloud in the sky for 10 minutes. No sound during the explosion. It was in the sky for a lot longer than what's shown here.\nFull video is 4 minutes : \nhttps://youtu.be/BzsTV_STlXQ\n\nUpdate: news is saying this was from Point Mugu, which isn't possible. This originated miles off the west coast over the ocean and traveled upward and inland. It did explode over the coast near Mugu, so if anything Mugu shot it down. This video starts facing south west oriented to San Clemente island and by the time of explosion I was facing north west. \n\nTo use this video in a commercial player or in broadcasts, please email licensing@rumble.com for more info",

      "description": "A shuriken (Japanese 手裏剣; literally: \"sword hidden in user's hand\") is a traditional Japanese concealed weapon that was generally used for throwing, and sometimes stabbing or slashing. Shuriken were invented in the Three-Year War by Tadamasa. He first created it from a short sword. They are sharpened hand-held blades made from a variety of everyday items, such as needles, nails and knives, as well as coins, washers, and other flat plates of metal. Shuriken is the name given to any small-bladed object, while shaken is traditionally used to indicate the well-known \"throwing star\".\nShuriken are commonly known in the West as throwing stars or ninja stars although they were originally designed in many different shapes. The major varieties of shuriken are the bō shuriken (棒手裏剣, stick shuriken) and the hira shuriken (平手裏剣, flat shuriken) or shaken (車剣, also read as kurumaken, wheel shuriken).\nShuriken were supplementary weapons to the sword or various other weapons in a samurai's arsenal, although they often had an important tactical effect in battle.  The art of wielding the shuriken is known as shurikenjutsu and was taught as a minor part of the martial arts curriculum of many famous schools, such as Yagyū Shinkage-ryū, Tenshin Shōden Katori Shintō-ryū, Ittō-ryū, Kukishin-ryū, and Togakure-ryū.\nContrary to popular belief, shuriken were not primarily intended as killing weapons, but rather in a secondary role[4] as a nuisance or distraction. Targets were primarily the more exposed parts of the body: the eyes, face, hands, or feet. The shuriken would sometimes be thrown in a way that slashed the opponent in a glancing blow and travelled on, becoming lost, causing the opponent to believe that the cut had been made by an invisible swordsman.\nShuriken, especially hira-shuriken, were also used in novel ways—they could be embedded in the ground, injuring those who stepped on them (similar to a caltrop or makibishi), wrapped in fuse to be lit and thrown to cause fire, or wrapped in a cloth soaked in poison and lit to cover an area with a cloud of poisonous smoke. They could also be used as a handheld weapon in close combat. There are reports of shuriken being coated with poison, intended either as a throwing weapon or to be left in a conspicuous place for a victim to pick up.[7] Other reports indicate that shuriken may have been buried in dirt or animal feces and allowed to harbor the bacterium Clostridium tetani—if the point penetrated a victim deeply enough, the bacteria transferred into the wound could cause a then-incurable tetanus infection.\nShuriken are simple weapons, but their historical value has increased. Unlike the treasured katana and other bladed weapons, antique shuriken are not often well preserved, largely due to their expendable nature.\nModern shuriken are most often made of stainless steel and are commercially available in many knife shops in Europe and North America, or via the Internet. They are illegal to possess or carry in some countries, such as Belgium, Canada,[9] Germany,[10] and the United Kingdom (manufacture, sale, distribution and import).[11] In the United States, some states prohibit them (e.g., California, Indiana,New York, while others allow them. In some cases they may be allowed but are still subject to specific local legislation. Owners may be required to possess a certificate for the possession of knives.",

The webinar will discuss how HAB sensors are used in drinking water treatment plants across Ohio to monitor for the presence and abundance of cyanobacteria in source and raw water. This session is intended to provide insight into the equipment needed, approximate costs, discuss how operators use data from the sensors in real-time, and how the sensors might help minimize treatment and monitoring costs.",

One other city is Rissani, around 40 kilometers from Merzouga, and from the 8th to the 14th century there was a separate kingdom, known as Sijilmassa, which was prosperous owing to former caravan routes.\n\nAlthough rainfall is very brief and uncommon, in 2006 flooding adjacent to the dunes destroyed many buildings and killed three people\n\nxiaomi yi camera\n\nsoundtrack from : Lawrence of Arabia",

And local residents, tribal leaders, and regional NGOs have come together to stop the water-pilfering corporation in its tracks.\n\nThey’ve launched a historic ballot initiative to prevent any major bottled water company from commercializing water anywhere in the region.\n\nFOLLOW ME @ https://www.facebook.com/WardoRants/",

Sources say Both fires were the responsibility of the Federal Government .. The Cable Crossing Fire and the Stouts Creek Fire.  One started allegedly by accident on BLM controlled property and crossed onto Swift Water park property .. WESTER RIVERS CONSERVANCY a front company for the Bureau of Land Management. Who's in the middle of negotiations to purchase this property because it is illegal for the Government to own land in the first place and or use funds from their funding source(as stated above)  Makes quick work of rendering a property devaluation on Swift Water Park which brings the negotiation to a halt for the moment.  The other fire which burnt 1000's of acres was fueled by timber was cut and left to rot or be fuel for fire.

We don't know all the details of what happened but we do know that as of Yesterday her attacker was arrested. \n\nWe pulled Chata out of the Modesto shelter yesterday and that same evening she arrived at the Veterinarian to begin care (where this video was captured). Today, less than 24 hours later she has received surgery. As of right now Chata will need a lot of care, both socializing and helping her heal. She's a very beautiful dog that has been through a lot this week, but we can't wait to see what happens when she realizes she's now in a safe place and all healed up. \n\nWe expect Chata's expense to be about $3,000. Because of this we are accepting donations for her care. \n\nTo Donate go to http://OrphanDog.org and click the Donate button \nor send a check to OrphanDog, P.O. Box 662, Lakeport, CA 95453.\n\nAny funds received above Chata's needs will be used to help other orphan dogs at the Orphan Dog Ranch.\n\nMusic: Prelude No. 22 by Chris Zabriskie is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\nSource: http://chriszabriskie.com/preludes/\nArtist: http://chriszabriskie.com/",

Shuts down Growth in order to force insolvency on   Communities and so desperate that their leaders will willfully or not to Give up lands to the federal government for handouts. \n\nThere are 4 things we will look at  1) How the Fed. Sends Communities into insolvency.  2)  Uses a Proxy company who's soul purpose is to  ACQUIRE LAND W/ WATER ATTACHMENTS .. this is against the Constitution Article 1 section 8 Clause 17 Property Ownership Restrictions on US Government\n3)  2 fires .. Sources say Both fires were the responsibility of the Federal Government .. The Cable Crossing Fire and the Stouts Creek Fire.  One started allegedly by accident on BLM controlled property and crossed onto Swift Water park property .. WESTER RIVERS CONSERVANCY a front company for the Bureau of Land Management. Who's in the middle of negotiations to purchase this property because it is illegal for the Government to own land in the first place and or use funds from their funding source(as stated above)  Makes quick work of rendering a property devaluation on Swift Water Park which brings the negotiation to a halt for the moment.  The other fire which burnt 1000's of acres was fueled by timber was cut and left to rot or be fuel for fire. At this property Fraud conservancy Group \"Oregon Wild\" Bent on blocking any and all land use!! \n4) Local politicians Refuse to listen to the people of the Community",

      "description": "789 Doral Trail, Redding, California\n\nThis unit is right on the corner of two streets and has a shaded driveway for most of the day. Upon entering the front do you come to a hallway with a closet. Just past you enter a large space that is a combined living room, dining room and the kitchen. Perfect for entertaining as you can communicate with others in the living room while cooking without any issues as both areas are open. There is a large bar area that would provide space for several people. The two french doors in the living room take you directly into the master bedroom. You will find a bath off of the master that has a full shower and a huge walk-in closet. One super awesome feature about this unit is the patio off the master. You have your own access to the community pool, spa and BBQ area. If you like to entertain, this is an incredible feature. Upstairs you will find another bedroom that is a good size and has its own bathroom and another closet. This unit will be getting a bit of touch up paint in the next few days and should look sharp when it is done. \n\nThe River Heights complex is located at the north or upper portion of Hilltop Drive off Riverbend Road.",

As I cross the Oregon state Line where it is legal for adults to use herbs as they see fit, it occurs to me again, the hypocrisy of California...supposedly the most progressive State when Weed is legal in DC and still an infraction in California and County Sheriffs still look the other way and allow Federal intrusion. California legalization has failed because the propositions have been poorly written by greedy scumbags with only personal gain in mind...and we can read.",

      "description": "Hundreds of firefighters were drafted in on Thursday to help protect communities on the edge of Flagstaff, Arizona, from a wildfire that is working its way across Oak Creek Canyon.\r\nThe fire started on Tuesday and has already burned 7.5 square miles (19.4 square kilometres) in and around the canyon, a scenic recreation area along a highway between Sedona and Flagstaff that normally would be teeming with tourists as the Memorial Day weekend approaches.\r\nThere have been no reports so far of injuries or structures burned.\r\nFire officials say the blaze is about 3 miles (7.7 kilometres) away from the residential areas of Forest Highlands and Kachina Village, where 3,200 residents are under pre-evacuation warnings. \r\nBut with smoke billowing over homes, many residents have already cleared out.\r\nThere is a chance, however, that the weather may help with weaker winds, slightly higher humidity and a chance of rain predicted for Friday.\r\n\r\n\r\nYou can license this story through AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/metadata/youtube/0713b8e16534a045c423ac327df54064 \r\nFind out more about AP Archive: http://www.aparchive.com/HowWeWork",

The peak shown burning is directly above Balch Camp to the left and the confluence of the NF Kings River and the Main Kings River on the right.  So far, the fire has been contained between the main Kings River on the right and the NF Kings to the left.  If the fire jumps either river, it will have uphill runs with lots of fuel towards populated areas.  At its eastern end, the fire did jump the SF Kings river and is presently threatening Hume Lake, Grant Grove and that whole area.",

      "title": "Have you seen a storm at the Dead Sea Israel?",
      "description": "Zahi Shaked A tour guide in Israel and his camera. \r\n+972 54 6905522\r\n\"Dead Sea\" , \"Sea of Salt\", also called the Salt Sea, is a salt lake bordering Jordan to the east, and Israel and the West Bank to the west. Its surface and shores are 422 metres (1,385 ft) below sea level,[2] the lowest elevation on the Earth's surface on dry land. The Dead Sea is 378 m (1,240 ft) deep, the deepest hypersaline lake in the world. It is also one of the world's saltiest bodies of water, with 33.7% salinity. Only Lake Assal (Djibouti), Garabogazköl and some hypersaline lakes of the McMurdo Dry Valleys in Antarctica (such as Don Juan Pond) have a higher salinity. It is 8.6 times more salty than the ocean.[4] This salinity makes for a harsh environment where animals cannot flourish, hence its name. The Dead Sea is 67 kilometres (42 mi) long and 18 kilometres (11 mi) wide at its widest point. It lies in the Jordan Rift Valley, and its main tributary is the Jordan River.\r\n\r\nThe Dead Sea has attracted visitors from around the Mediterranean basin for thousands of years. Biblically, it was a place of refuge for King David. It was one of the world's first health resorts (for Herod the Great), and it has been the supplier of a wide variety of products, from balms for Egyptian mummification to potash for fertilizers. People also use the salt and the minerals from the Dead Sea to create cosmetics and herbal sachets. In 2009, 1.2 million foreign tourists visited on the Israeli side.\r\n\r\nThe sea has a density of 1.24kg/L, making swimming difficult.The Dead Sea is an endorheic lake located in the Jordan Rift Valley, a geographic feature formed by the Dead Sea Transform (DST). This left lateral-moving transform fault lies along the tectonic plate boundary between the African Plate and the Arabian Plate. It runs between the East Anatolian Fault zone in Turkey and the northern end of the Red Sea Rift offshore of the southern tip of Sinai.\r\n\r\nThe Jordan River is the only major water source flowing into the Dead Sea, although there are small perennial springs under and around the Dead Sea, creating pools and quicksand pits along the edges.[7] There are no outlet streams.\r\n\r\nRainfall is scarcely 100 mm (3.9 in) per year in the northern part of the Dead Sea and barely 50 mm (2.0 in) in the southern part. The Dead Sea zone's aridity is due to the rainshadow effect of the Judean Hills. The highlands east of the Dead Sea receive more rainfall than the Dead Sea itself.\r\n\r\nTo the west of the Dead Sea, the Judean Hills rise less steeply and are much lower than the mountains to the east. Along the southwestern side of the lake is a 210 m (690 ft) tall halite formation called \"Mount Sodom\".There are two contending hypotheses about the origin of the low elevation of the Dead Sea. The older hypothesis is that it lies in a true rift zone, an extension of the Red Sea Rift, or even of the Great Rift Valley of eastern Africa. A more recent hypothesis is that the Dead Sea basin is a consequence of a \"step-over\" discontinuity along the Dead Sea Transform, creating extension of the crust with consequent subsidence.\r\n\r\nAround three million years ago, what is now the valley of the Jordan River, Dead Sea, and Wadi Arabah was repeatedly inundated by waters from the Mediterranean Sea. The waters formed in a narrow, crooked bay which was connected to the sea through what is now the Jezreel Valley. The floods of the valley came and went depending on long scale climate change. The lake that occupied the Dead Sea Rift, named \"Lake Sodom\", deposited beds of salt, eventually coming to be 3 km (1.9 mi) thick.\r\n\r\nApproximately two million years ago, the land between the Rift Valley and the Mediterranean Sea rose to such an extent that the ocean could no longer flood the area. Thus, the long bay became a lake.Masada (Hebrew מצדה, pronounced  Metzada (help•info), from מצודה, metzuda, \"fortress\") is the name for a site of ancient palaces and fortifications in the South District of Israel on top of an isolated rock plateau, or horst, on the eastern edge of the Judean Desert overlooking the Dead Sea. After the First Jewish-Roman War a siege of the fortress by troops of the Roman Empire led to the mass suicide of the Sicarii rebels, who preferred death to surrender. It is located about 20 km east of Arad",

Des débris de verre causés par l'onde de choc étaient présents jusqu'à trois kilomètres à la ronde autour du lieu du sinistre.\n\nLes quelques vidéo de l'explosion visibles sur internet montre l'ampleur de l'explosion.\n\nEnjoy!",

      "description": "The explosion in eastern China that rocked one of the world’s busiest ports still poses some logistics problems despite resuming operations, as some executives and analysts report hurdles to getting goods and commodities where they are needed.\nAuthorities and companies near the blast site in the eastern Chinese city of Tianjin said operations there were returning to normal. Still, some executives said bottlenecks remained for industries from steel production to oil refining.\n“The whole area near the Tianjin port has been blocked because of the blast,” said Rahul Goel, head of projects planning at General Nice Group, a commodities trader with operations in Tianjin. “There is no transportation. The seaborne material can still come into port, but it cannot go out.”\nThe big question now is how long the transport challenges drag on in the aftermath of Wednesday night’s explosion, which killed at least 56 and hospitalized some 700 others.\n“There are a lot of steel mills in the area that are unable to get their supply of iron ore,” said Mr. Goel.\nAuthorities blocked one company’s access to 16,000 tons of iron ore stored near the explosion, while it diverted another 170,000 tons set to arrive in Tianjin on Saturday to the port of Rizhao just south of the city, said one Singapore-based trader at the company. But the trader said the company was confident it could get shipments to customers. In an apparent reference to China’s slowing trade sector, the trader said, “Have you seen the ports in China? They’re huge, and perhaps there is now some use of all this capacity.”\n\nOther companies that depend on the port at Tianjin were more upbeat. Anglo-Australian mining giant BHP Billiton Ltd. said Friday it didn’t anticipate any direct impact on its shipments through the port. It said iron-ore berths at the port were operating, and that customs clearance there had resumed.\n\nChevron Corp. said it had resumed operations at a lubricant facility located about 5 kilometers from the accident site, which it had suspended following the blast. A Chevron spokesman said the facility sustained minor roof damage. Technology firms with manufacturing operations in Tianjin, including Lenovo Group Ltd., said business had been unaffected.\n\nAbout 40% of imported cars sold in China come through Tianjin, said Wang Cun, an analyst at China Automobile Trading Co. But inventories are high—enough to last 2½ months according to official auto data—because China’s auto market is softening. Some car makers affected by the explosions, such as Volkswagen AG, said they would ensure timely deliveries via the southern ports of Shanghai and Guangzhou.\n\nTianjin’s maritime authority said in an online post Friday that besides oil tankers and ships carrying what it termed hazardous materials, the port was operating normally. Berth operators reached by phone said the flow of goods had resumed. The port operator, Tianjin Port (Group) Co., referred questions to government officials.\n\nThe accident came as China prepares for major celebrations in Beijing to mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II next month. Security is already running high in the regions around the capital, and nervy officials may further tighten or restrict the flow of goods to avoid a repeat accident, analysts said.\n\naerial images for the disaster explosion in Tianjin port 中国における災害の爆発のための空間像,for more information about china world news visit site at http://youtube.com/user/cosmeticmachines as well as business website at http://penglaichina.com",

We are about 2kms away from the blast and the closest building in Wantong to the blast site. At 11:30pm we heard the first explosion, just to get up and look out the window to witness a HUGE blast, 300 foot fireball and smoke that disappeared into the night sky. The blast was followed by the most scariest BOOM i've ever heard. The shockwave destroyed our windows, blew the doors out and destroyed a wall connecting to the office. Glass and blood was everywhere. It is difficult to believe that we walked away with only a few cuts and stitches.

The next moment, everyone is fleeing down the stairs.\n\nThe blasts, one of which was the equivalent of more than 20 tons of TNT exploding, left at least 56 dead, 700 injured and thousands homeless, officials say. About 6,000 people were displaced by the fire and explosions.",

      "description": "China Tianjin Explosion Civil Bureau and Volunteers Confrontation\n\nChina Tianjin, Tanggu:\n\nVolunteers and Charity organisation from the Tianjin explosion accident are very upset with the Civil Affairs Bureau.  The Bureau told them to leave as the Armed Police has arrived to take over the situation.  All donated item from the volunteers are confiscated, however, in the public annoucement, the Government told the reporters that all these items are donated by Civil Administration.  The Volunteer are upset with this arrangement.  They claimed that the secretary wearing black clothes in the video is the person-in-charge.\n\nA week on from a series of explosions in the port area of Tianjin, the confirmed death toll stands at 114, including 53 firefighters and seven police. Sixty-four are still missing, including another 49 firefighters and four police, while 674 are in hospital, 56 of them in critical condition. Contamination by hazardous chemicals is a source of ongoing concern: though some have described the white foam appearing in the area as “a normal phenomenon” and “very common after rains in Tianjin,” the Tianjin Environmental Protection Bureau has warned that the water could produce dangerous hydrogen cyanide vapor.\n\nIn the immediate aftermath, propaganda officials issued several directives to domestic media ordering the exclusive use of “authoritative” news copy, and forbidding independent reporting, individual interpretation, live broadcasts, and private social media posts. But as CDT founder Xiao Qiang told NPR’s Robert Siegel, “those instructions, in this case, was only partially effective. There are – a large amount of Chinese media send their reporters to the site anyway even they know maybe at the end of the day they cannot publish some of those reporting.” China Media Project’s David Bandurski described on Medium how “Chinese media attempted, with qualified success (decent reports were in many cases short-lived), to push the envelope on Tianjin coverage. There are plenty of publications that deserve singling out, and the upshot is that we should feel somewhat encouraged — very cautiously optimistic — that Chinese media are still capable and professionally hungry, despite serious limitations in the past few years.” At the Global Investigative Journalism Network, Ying Chan and Karen Chang tracked various publications’ efforts to uncover the causes and culprits, laying bare zoning violations, murky corporate ownership structures, and an array of signs that corruption had set the stage for the disaster.",

      "description": "The warehouse at the centre of last week’s explosions in the Chinese city of Tianjin received a licence to handle hazardous chemicals just two months before the disaster, China’s state-run news agency has reported.\nXinhua said on Tuesday that Tianjin Dongjiang Port Rui Hai International Logistics, the company that owns the warehouse, did not have legal permission to handle such dangerous materials between October 2014 and June 2015. But the company had continued to work with hazardous chemicals, Xinhua reported, citing an unidentified company official.\nLocal media reported that the president and vice-chairman of the company were among the 10 Rui Hai workers who were detained by authorities as early as last Thursday, the day after the blasts.\n\nAccording to state media reports, Rui Hai company president Yu Xuewei and vice-chairman Dong Shexuan were put “under control” on the afternoon after the blasts. Local news outlet Caijing reports that four of the Rui Hai workers are in hospital and six others are at Tianjin No 1 Detention Centre.\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon a former deputy mayor of Tianjin and current director of the State Administration of Work Safety – the country’s work safety watchdog – was also put under investigation.\n\nYang Dongliang, who was vice-mayor of Tianjin between 2009 and 2012, is suspected of “serious violations of discipline and law”, according to a statement published on the government’s anti-graft website. \n\nThe news came as rain hit the site of last week’s devastating blasts for the first time on Tuesday morning, raising fears that it might set off more chemical reactions, potentially creating toxic gas, endangering local residents and hampering rescue efforts.\n\nResidents have been on high alert since news of the toxic chemicals circulated, with local media reports showing many wearing gas masks and accompanied by armed police when returning to their homes to pick up belongings.\n\nAuthorities are concerned that the rain will react with up to 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide discovered at two locations at the hazardous goods storage facility. Officials announced the discovery of more dangerous chemicals on Tuesday.\n\nNiu Yuegang, deputy director at Tianjin’s fire department, confirmed that over 40 different types of chemicals have now been discovered at the blast site, including 700 tonnes of sodium cyanide, 800 tonnes of ammonium nitrate and 500 tonnes of potassium nitrate, according to local reports.\n\nDrone footage taken by rescue workers and broadcast on state TV channel CCTV indicated that the enormous crater at the centre of the blast had filled with water as early as Friday afternoon, two days after the blast.\n\nChina  Sodium cyanide levels well past limit at Tianjin after blast explosion 天津爆炸后現重度化學污染,for more information about china world news visit site at http://youtube.com/user/cosmeticmachines as well as business website at http://penglaichina.com",

Sometimes the best way to learn to pack a backpack or set up your camp bed is to watch someone do it. Thru-hikers get into a daily grind, unpack, sleep, pack, hike, unpack, day after day on the trail. This short video captures one of those days for Sage.

Located at the confluence of the Bitterroot River and the Clark Fork River, Kelly Island is a day-use area that was reserved just for us.  \n\nThe habitat of this large 648-acre, undeveloped island is a unique mix of cottonwood bottoms, large meadows, and ponderosa pine forests with remarkable wildlife populations.  The air was not as crisp and clear as it normally is in western Montana due to smoke from unprecedented forest fires burning in the Pacific Northwest. \n \nThis area is home to many species of birds and other wildlife. The site is open to the public and is used for day hikes, dog walking and wildlife watching. \n\nKelly Island fishing access site has just been upgraded with paved roads, defined parking, boat launch and restrooms.\n\nPlease see my other video “Stunning Change of Seasons on Kelly Island” captured in October a few years ago:  https://youtu.be/V6i8kR-dc2I\n\nThis sequence was captured with an aerial camera system on a DJI Phantom 3 quad copter, AKA drone or UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.)  The video was edited in Adobe Premier CS6.\n\nMusic used: \"Dreams Become Real\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\nDirect Link: http://incompetech.com/music/royalty-free/index.html?isrc=USUAN1500027.\nISRC: USUAN1500027\n© 2015 Kevin MacLeod",

      "description": "This is a view of heavy rain from the window of the office of OOJO - Digital Marketing Agency in Singapore.\n\nIn the month of September 2015, Singapore had a really long hot and dry spell. The haze made it worse. People's health was affected.\n\nMany people prayed for rain for a long time. Yesterday, 15 September 2015, it rained heavily. Finally! Whew!\n\nAnd today too. we managed to capture the video.\n\nAbout Haze in Singapore:\n=====================\nThe haze is caused by fire at the forests of Kalimantan, South Sumatra and parts of Riau. It's very sad. The Indonesia forests are filled with rich biological diverse lives and is considered a natural heritage. The haze is endangering the health of Indonesians, Malaysians and Singaporeans.\n\nThe haze can also cause economic loss to the three countries. The fires are also causing harm to the world because of the carbon emitted into the atmosphere. The United States National Aeronautics and Space Administration (Nasa) has warned that the haze this year could be as bad as that in 1997 when the United Nations declared the forest fires in Indonesia an ecological disaster for the world.\n\nThis is not a new problem. It has been happening for almost 2 decades annually. There are laws in Indonesia that forbid the use of fire to clear land. The leaders of Indonesia have declined offers of assistance from Malaysia and Singapore to help put out the fires. They believe they have the capacity to do it on their own.\n\nAbout OOJO:\n===========\nOOJO is a full service Digital Marketing Agency in Singapore.

      "description": "The dawn chorus was recorded on a typical hazy morning in a small urban residential garden in Singapore. The chorus started 15 minutes later than usual when the air was free of haze. At 0645 hours, when it was no more dark, there were isolated bird calls, devoid of the normal chorus of rich gurgling sounds of the Yellow-vented Bulbuls (Pycnonotus goiavier) in a background of other calls. The very subdued chorus lasted about 30 minutes. The haze, a result of prolonged forest fires in Indonesia, was considered moderate, with a PSI (Pollution Standards Index) of under 100, very much lower than at other times.",

      "description": "My initial idea for this duet originally titled 'Casa' was to focus on developing a movement language that has accompanied me for 16 years – my live improvisations in the privacy of my many bedrooms across Europe. In those cheap, sometimes dirty and cold places I used to do contact improvisation with furniture. I discovered on the floor my very best dance partner supporting my weight through any complicated movement phrase. If you don’t know me well, you are certainly unaware of the fact that I spend a lot of time upside down. I also prefer to rewind any idea instead of displaying an organic progression of my thoughts. They are scattered in my immediate environment. Choreography gives me time to think, and space to experiment my ideas. I organised them after all, this time in a beautiful sequence of movements where pauses play a crucial role, allowing the audience to breathe and sync in the entire dance material. I decided to take the dance material of Casa out into the streets on Singapore in a response to the terrible Haze we have been suffering. I soon realised that the same material that work on a traditional stage opens new perspectives when performed outdoors, closer to the audiences.",

      "description": "This is a self reporting of the current haze situation in Singapore and the worsening new 356 hotspot in Indonesia. \n\nYesterday 19th Oct 2015 around 11pm, Singapore have the worst PM2.5 PSI readings at the highest of the year at 471 at the west of Singapore and 301on the south.\n\nAccording to online source\nhttp://www.airinfonow.org/html/ed_particulate.html\n\nBoth PM10 (big) and PM2.5 (small) particles can cause health problems; specifically respiratory health (that's the lungs and airway). Because the PM2.5 travels deeper into the lungs AND because the PM2.5 is made up things that are more toxic (like heavy metals and cancer causing organic compounds), PM2.5 can have worse health effects than the bigger PM10.\n\nExposure to particulate matter leads to increased use of medication and more visits to the doctor or emergency room. Health effects include the following:\n\nCoughing, wheezing, shortness of breath \nAggravated asthma\nLung damage (including decreased lung function and lifelong respiratory disease) \nPremature death in individuals with existing heart or lung diseases\n\nIf we check http://earth.nullschool.net/#2015/10/20/0900Z/chem/surface/level/overlay=cosc/orthographic=-253.84,-0.02,3000\n\nYou can see expanding carbon monoxide concentration since this morning 11am. This means spreading of hotspots.\n\nAccording to \nhttp://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/singapore/more-than-350-hotspots/2205584.html?cid=twtcna\n\nA total of 356 hotspots were detected in Sumatra on Tuesday (Oct 20), an increase from the 230 detected the day before, the National Environment Agency (NEA) reported.\n\nThis is a cause for concern for those asthmatic, my suggestion is to keep your N95 mask on hand and wear it whenever you smell the burning smell or find out the 1 hour PM 2.5 PSI readings is too high.\n\nhttp://www.nea.gov.sg/anti-pollution-radiation-protection/air-pollution-control/psi/pollutant-concentrations/type/PM25-1Hr#pollutant",

      "description": "A day after seeming to question Texas Sen. Ted Cruz's Evangelical credentials in Iowa, GOP front-runner Donald Trump took the stage in Aiken, South Carolina on Saturday for an hour-long town hall -- and didn't mention Cruz once, or repeat his barb that \"not a lot of Evangelicals come out of Cuba.\" In fact, he didn't mention a single one of his opponents for the Republican nomination -- a rarity for Trump on the campaign trail.\nTrump did address his veiled shot at Cruz on Fox News earlier in the day.\n\"I think I sort of mean it,\" Trump said, right after saying that his Des Moines comment \"sort of was fun.\"\n\"A lot of Catholics come out of Cuba and a lot of great people come out of Cuba,\" Trump said. \"Frankly, I know many of them. But I was having a little fun with Ted. We have a little fun together.\"\nIn Aiken, Trump talked about a number of topics that are typically not mainstays of his stump speech. Seated in a packed gymnasium at the University of South Carolina-Aiken, Trump took questions for an hour from South Carolina Attorney General Alan Wilson, as part of the Conservative Leadership Project's seventh presidential forum.\nWilson is the son of Congressman Joe Wilson, famous for yelling \"You lie!\" at President Barack Obama during a speech to a joint session of Congress.\nTrump answered what he would be looking for in a Supreme Court justice appointee. While saying that the next president might appoint four justices, Trump said \"the balance right now has gotten not so good.\" Trump went on to say to applause that he wanted \"strongly conservative\" justices and \"great scholars\" that \"respect and admire\" our Constitution.\nLater in the town hall, Trump said that, on the current bench, he admired \"highly underrated\" Justice Clarence Thomas because he has been \"consistent\" and that Justice Samuel Alito is \"terrific.\"\nTrump also took questions about EPA regulations, the Dodd-Frank banking reform bill and his plans for the Affordable Care Act, should he become president. On EPA regulations, Trump gave a particularly winding answer about how different areas have varying levels of water supplies. He accused the EPA of overregulating.\n\"You know, I'll give you one regulation, So I build, and I build a lot of stuff. And I go into areas where they have tremendous water, I won't use names, but tremendous water,\" Trump said. \"And you have sinks where the water doesn't come out. Right? We all know, you go buy a new sink. And you turn it on, well, aw, I want to wash my hands. You have showers where I can't wash my hair properly, it's a disaster!\"\nHe continued, \"...Now there's no water problem, you know it's one thing in the desert. The problem is you stay under the shower for five times as long, you end up wasting more water than you would've the other way.\"\nTrump once again touted his plan to ban all Muslims from entering the country temporarily, saying that many of those who disagreed with him earlier this week are coming around.\n\"We have to get our country under control,\" Trump said. \"And all of a sudden I see the same thing. It was pretty brutal four days ago, for Trump, do you agree?... Now all of a sudden you're seeing everyone coming in, I'm even seeing liberal hosts, and people, they're saying you know, he's got a point.\"",

He’s been jaywalking! Leave him alone, he didn’t do anything wrong!”\n\n“Stop resisting!” the cop shouts, not paying any attention.\n\nThe boy is seen sitting in shock, with his face in his hands, with a group of passers-by watching. The cop who detained the guy apparently called for reinforcement as more cops arrive at the scene to detain the jaywalker.\n\nFour police officers come up to the teen and wrestle him to the ground. Then another four law enforcers cordon off the scene from the public.\n\nIn the end, there are nine officers involved in detaining the jaywalker. Finally, the teenager is handcuffed and marched off to a police car. \n\n• Subcribe for More: http://www.youtube.com/user/PressTVNews1?sub_confirmation=1\n\n☑ Feel free to Subscribe ☑ Feel free to Like ☑ Feel free to Share",

They will be divided into 10 crews of 20 soldiers each and sent Sunday to a wildfire to be determined.\n\nAn estimated 95 wildfires are burning across 1.1 million acres of land in seven Western states, taxing firefighters and budgets. \n\n Before deployment, the soldiers will be trained as firefighters for one day in a classroom and two days in the field, the National Interagency Fire Center said.\n\nActive-duty military personnel have been mobilized 35 times since 1987 to fight wildfires, the center said. The last time was in 2006, when a battalion from Lewis-McChord helped fight a fire in Washington state.\n\nIn the current wildfire outbreak, California, Washington and Oregon have also mobilized the National Guard.",

In 2002 there were 44 large air tankers on exclusive use contracts but that number declined over the next 12 years to a low point of 9 in 2013.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\nUSFS Multi-year full time exclusive use (14)\nT-118 HC-130H U.S. Forest Service\nT-105 MD-87 Aero Air, LLC\nT-101 MD87 Aero Air, LLC\nT-161 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-160 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-260 CL-415 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-912 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-131 C-130 Coulson\nT-10 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-43 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-06 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-45 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-05 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-07 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-44 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\n\nUSFS Call When Needed (part time) (9)\nT-911 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-910 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-02 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-01 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-41 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-40 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-162 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-163 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-164 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\n\nCanadian government (borrowed) (3)\nT-154 CV580 Alberta\nT-173 CV580 Saskatchewan\nT-174 CV580 Saskatchewan\n\nCanadian companies (3)\nT-155 CV580 Conair\nT-142 C-440 Conair\nT-152 CV580 Conair\n\nMAFFS C-130s (4)\nMAFFS 2 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air Force Base\nMAFFS 5 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air Force Base\nMAFFS 1 153rd Airlift Wing, Wyoming Air National Guard\nMAFFS 9 145th Airlift Wing, North Carolina Air National Guard\n\nIt is interesting that Aero Flite has five RJ85s converted, certified, staffed, and actively fighting fires, and Neptune has five BAe-146s doing the same.

      "description": "08/14/2015 lightning started fires in Chelan, WA. On 08/15 the Yacht Club was evacuated and by 08/19/15 the fire moved very close to the Yacht Club Villa with 100 homes. New Fire lines were cut and old ones were cleared and widened. Many retardant drops were made above the homes and firefighters spent 24 hours a day keeping watch on our property. In the early hours of 08/20/15 the fire exploded and it looked like our homes would be gone. Firefighters stationed themselves throughout the Villa and watered things down to help keep our property safe. The fire stopped right where the fire line was made and where retardant was dropped. The fire moved its way north. Without all the firefighters and National Guard we would have lost all 100 homes.  The club members and other area residents began serving evening meals to all the fire crews as they changed shifts. As many as 180 firefighters have been fed each evening to thank them for saving our homes and working to get this fire out. The dinners were served for a week starting 08/23/2015.  THANK YOU ALL FIREFIGHTERS !!!\nThanks to The Coleman Brothers for recording the song and Thank You to Judy Kellersberger and Mike Black for writing this great song!!!",

In 2002 there were 44 large air tankers on exclusive use contracts but that number declined over the next 12 years to a low point of 9 in 2013.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\nUSFS Multi-year full time exclusive use (14)\nT-118 HC-130H U.S. Forest Service\nT-105 MD-87 Aero Air, LLC\nT-101 MD87 Aero Air, LLC\nT-161 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-160 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-260 CL-415 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-912 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-131 C-130 Coulson\nT-10 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-43 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-06 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-45 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-05 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-07 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-44 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\n\nUSFS Call When Needed (part time) (9)\nT-911 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-910 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-02 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-01 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-41 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-40 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-162 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-163 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-164 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\n\nCanadian government (borrowed) (3)\nT-154 CV580 Alberta\nT-173 CV580 Saskatchewan\nT-174 CV580 Saskatchewan\n\nCanadian companies (3)\nT-155 CV580 Conair\nT-142 C-440 Conair\nT-152 CV580 Conair\n\nMAFFS C-130s (4)\nMAFFS 2 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air Force Base\nMAFFS 5 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air Force Base\nMAFFS 1 153rd Airlift Wing, Wyoming Air National Guard\nMAFFS 9 145th Airlift Wing, North Carolina Air National Guard\n\nIt is interesting that Aero Flite has five RJ85s converted, certified, staffed, and actively fighting fires, and Neptune has five BAe-146s doing the same.

New Fire lines were cut and old ones were cleared and widened. Many retardant drops were made above the homes and firefighters spent 24 hours a day keeping watch on our property. In the early hours of 08/20/15 the fire exploded and it looked like our homes would be gone. Firefighters stationed themselves throughout the Villa and watered things down to help keep our property safe. The fire stopped right where the fire line was made and where retardant was dropped. The fire moved its way north. Without all the firefighters and National Guard we would have lost all 100 homes.  The club members and other area residents began serving evening meals to all the fire crews as they changed shifts. As many as 180 firefighters have been fed each evening to thank them for saving our homes and working to get this fire out. The dinners were served for a week starting 08/23/2015.  THANK YOU ALL FIREFIGHTERS !!!\nThanks to The Coleman Brothers for recording the song and Thank You to Judy Kellersberger and Mike Black for writing this great song!!!",

With recent rainfall the mountain was brought back to life in time for the finals. The course was in supreme condition with incredible traction and consistent track conditions, the racing was excellent. Coming into the finals I held a fair points lead and needed to place higher than 15th to retain the overall points lead. Managing a 5th place locked in my 1st in overall points for the season, wrapping up my first racing season with a 1st place Cat 2 championship. I would like to thank my brother Jason Watts (J.W Construction) for supporting me throughout the racing season. Helping to foot the bill for my road trips across the Pacific Northwest. I also owe a big thanks to Timber Trails, allowing me to service my bike and make a living, all while bailing out on work routinely to go ride my bike. Thanks Timber Dale. Thanks to everyone else who helped provide me the means to get to race day, as well as anyone who wished me well. .  Bam! Looking forward to the 2016 riding/racing season!",

      "description": "VINTAGE EXTINCT ATTRACTIONS DISNEYLAND Tom Sawyer Island Attraction Injun Joe's Cave: infaMOUSEproject is mostly Disney Rides, Shows, & POV Attraction videos taken at Disneyland Park & Disney California Adventure Park in the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Epcot & Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, and Universal Studios Theme Parks all of them are in America so far.Guests visit the island, surrounded by the Rivers of America, by traveling on a motorized raft which is piloted by a Disneyland cast member. While aboard the Sailing Ship Columbia or Mark Twain Riverboat, Disneyland guests travel clockwise around the island. Looking to starboard, they can see the many areas and adventure opportunities of the island. To port, they see Disneyland itself and from time to time will see a Disneyland Railroad train passing by. At the northern end of the island, inaccessible to guests, is the Burning Settler's Cabin, a cabin that used to actually burn by spewing fire from its roof. Despite guest complaints, the park no longer ignites the roof of the cabin with propane each time a watercraft passes by. The Walt Disney World version lasted until 2006, where the pipes (the originals from 1971) were damaged by age and being turned off while the Riverboat was under \"rehab\".\n\nOver the years, there have been theme changes to the cabin itself: originally, it was said to have been set afire by a hostile native tribe. This storyline was eventually changed due to complaints from Native American guests, so it was said to have been the home of a moonshiner who had fallen into a drunken stupor when he should have been minding his still; later, after the live flames were eliminated, the fire was described (at least in the Mark Twain steamboat narration) as the result of unspecified carelessness, and as having left not only the cabin's owner homeless, but also some of the local wildlife. In 2007, the outward appearance of the house was cleaned up and all fire damage was removed, making it just another homestead along the waters. Currently, narration (and dialogue from the cabin itself) indicates that it is the home of Mike Fink, keelboater and self-proclaimed \"King of the River.\"\n\nThe most prominent structure on the island, viewable from Frontierland, Adventureland and New Orleans Square, is Lafitte's Tavern, which was formerly Harper's Mill.",

      "description": "STABILIZED Disneyland Railroad w/ GPS & MPH info (Part 1/2) at Disneyland in California 2015: infaMOUSEproject is mostly Disney Rides, Shows, & POV Attraction videos taken at Disneyland Park & Disney California Adventure Park in the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, Epcot & Magic Kingdom at Walt Disney World in Florida, and Universal Studios Theme Parks all of them are in America so far. The 1.5-mile (2.4 km) loop originally only stopped at Main Street or Frontierland. The Frontierland Station was renovated when that section of the park became New Orleans Square in 1966. It was renamed to be the New Orleans Square station at a later date. The loop was expanded to stop at Fantasyland (which became Mickey's Toontown station) and Tomorrowland.\n\nMain Street Station is designed to coordinate architecturally with the rest of Main Street, and is the first Disneyland structure visitors see upon entering the park. A sign on the roof shows an elevation of 138 feet (42 m) above sea level (though this figure is only approximate) and a population number that roughly corresponds with the number of visitors to the park over the past nearly six decades. As of March 2013 the number stood at 650 million.[8] An ornately decorated Kalamazoo handcar is on permanent display in front of the station on the former passing turnout once utilized by Retlaw 2, the Frontierland freight train, when each train stopped for passengers only at its own station. It is rumored that the handcar was donated to Walt Disney himself around 1955 by railroad historian and Disney friend Jerry Best. However, there is no evidence of this even in the Disney Archives. On display inside the station are various photos and print articles pertaining to DLRR history, vintage penny scale and Orchestron player and a replica of Walt's 1/8 scale live-steam garden railroad locomotive Lilly Belle; the original engine, tender and the caboose with detailed interior hand-crafted entirely by Walt was in the display case for many years on loan from the Disney family, which are now featured at the Walt Disney Family Museum.\n\nThe journey from Main Street station travels northwest along Disneyland's border, just outside the park's main berm from the Jungle Cruise. Guests get a glimpse of an antelope on the berm and for many years a cougar yowled at the trains before the train passes through Pirates of the Caribbean themed as Mardi Gras Carnival staging area.\n\nNew Orleans Square Station platform shelter is stylistically similar to Main Street Station. The Depot building on the west side of the tracks (inspired by the Grizzly Flats Railroad Depot) originally served as the station platform; in 1962 it was removed from service and moved across the realigned tracks, in preparation for the New Orleans Square expansion, which now serves primarily as an ornamental detail and break room for train crews. The Land Line Telegraphy extension of Morse code sound effect heard emanating from the depot Telegraph Office, historically used by telegraphers on operating railroads, repeats endlessly the first two lines of Walt Disney's 1955 opening day speech \"To all who come to this happy place: Welcome. Disneyland is your land. Here age relives fond memories of the past, and here youth may savor the challenge and promise of the future.\"\n\nThe journey from New Orleans Square, the train passes into a tunnel through the berm between the Haunted Mansion's facade and show building. Shortly thereafter passengers catch a glimpse of Splash Mountain's \"Zip-a-Dee Lady\" riverboat finale scene before crossing over Critter Country Lane on a trestle. The track then follows the outer edge of the Rivers of America, where guests glimpse minor wildlife scenes, a friendly Indian chief on a horse, and a view of a settler's log cabin across the river on Tom Sawyer's Island. Originally, the Burning Settler's Cabin was shown being under attack by Indians, with roof, door and windows ablaze, accompanied by Indian war chants, war-whoops and hollers coming from the distance with an arrow in the back of the settler fallen in front of his cabin; these elements were modified in the 1970s to represent a victim of evil river pirates complete with unconvincing fire of blown cellophane and silk ala Pirates of the Caribbean (attraction), the exploded alcohol still of an inebriated moonshiner (now with real fire again) in the 1980s, an eagle's nest threatened by the careless settler's blaze in the early 1990s, all of which proved politically incorrect and was eventually extinguished at the end of 1999. During the Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island makeover, asbestos was removed and the cabin refurbished to represent a sustainable homestead. The train then passes behind Festival of Fools picnic grounds, through a tunnel in the berm (actually the heavy equipment bridge to the interior,) and into Toontown Depot.",

Frontierland is one of the \"themed lands\" at the many Disneyland-style parks run by Disney around the world. Themed to the American Old West of the 19th century, Frontierlands are home to cowboys and pioneers, saloons, red rock buttes and gold rushes. Every instance of Frontierland has a Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, and a stretch of riverfront. Other attractions sometimes found in this land include Big Thunder Mountain, the Country Bear Jamboree, Tom Sawyer Island and a steam-powered riverboat.\nDedication\n\n    Frontierland. It is here that we experience the story of our country's past. The color, romance and drama of frontier America as it developed from wilderness trails to roads, riverboats, railroads and civilization. A tribute to the faith, courage and ingenuity of our hearty pioneers who blaze the trails and made this progress possible.\n    — Walter E. Disney, July 17, 1955\n\nFrontierland first appeared in Disneyland as one of five original themed lands. Conceived by Walt Disney, the land did not initially contain many attractions, but centered on open expanses of wilderness which could be traversed by guests via stagecoach, pack mules, Conestoga wagon,and walking trails. The Mine Train Thru Nature's Wonderland opened in 1960, consisting of a sedate train ride around various western landscape dioramas. The Mine Train closed in 1977 to make way for a new attraction; the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened in 1979.\n\nDisneyland's Frontierland gateway is constructed of ponderosa pine logs. The land's long shoreline along the Rivers of America is considered a prime viewing location for the nighttime Fantasmic! show. The docks to both the Mark Twain Riverboat and the Sailing Ship Columbia, (a replica of American explorer Robert Gray's 18th century ship that circumnavigated the globe) are located here, and Tom Sawyer Island in the river's center is also considered a property of Frontierland\n\nFrontierland's buildings have lots of detail too. On the roof of the Westward Ho Trading Co., there are elk or deer antlers. Elk antlers were commonly placed on general stores in the old west so cowboys coming into town immediately knew where to get supplies. Also in Frontierland is a building that has a large sign that says \"Laod Bhang Co. Fireworks Factory\". Plus, at the storefront marked \"Crockett and Russel Hat Co.\", you'll find a window honoring Fess Parker, who played Davy Crockett in Walt Disney's Davy Crockett. Frontierland borders Fantasyland (via the Big Thunder Trail), New Orleans Square and Adventureland, and connects to the Central Plaza through an iconic set of fort-style gates.\nAttractions and entertainment\n\n    Big Thunder Mountain Railroad\n    Big Thunder Ranch (closing January 2016)\n    Fantasmic!\n    Frontierland Shootin' Exposition\n    Mark Twain Riverboat\n    Pirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island\n    Sailing Ship Columbia\n    Legends of Frontierland\n\nFormer attractions and entertainment\n\n    Mike Fink Keel Boats (1955–1997)\n    Woody’s Roundup\n    Little Patch of Heaven Petting Farm\n    Burning Settler’s Cabin\n    Casa de Fritos\n    Casa Mexicana\n\n    Ceremonial Dance Circle\n    Conestoga Wagons\n    Dixieland Band Stand\n    Festival of Fools\n    Fort Wilderness (1956-2003)[1]\n    Indian Village\n    Nature's Wonderland\n    Rainbow Caverns Mine Traine\n    Rainbow Ridge Pack Mules\n    Silver Banjo Barbecue\n    Stagecoach Ride\n\nRestaurants and refreshments\n\n    The Golden Horseshoe Cafe\n    Stage Door Cafe\n    Rancho del Zocalo Restaurante\n    River Belle Terrace\n    Big Thunder Ranch Barbecue (Closing January 2016)\n\nFormer restaurants and refreshments\n\n    McDonald's in Disneyland\n\nShops\n\n    The Spirit of Pocahontas Shop\n    Bonanza Outfitters\n    Westward Ho Trading Company\n    Pioneer Mercantile\n    Silver Spur",

      "description": "~ Ok, We just returned from camping in Yucaipa Regional Park in California, and it was our first time using the Bushnell Shield Series 15' x 9' Instant Cabin Tent, Sleeps 9 ( You can only get it from Walmart).\n\n- We went camping with the in-laws couple of months ago and they let us use their 6 person Coleman tent, after that weekend I decided We needed to get our own,  I did a little research and found this tent.  The main reason why I bought it, it is because it's an instant tent, it took us less than 9 minutes to set up, we weren't in a hurry, we just wanted to do it right, I didn't read any instructions, because I previously watched the product video demo, and it was pretty easy to setup.\n\n~ We spent  3 days and two nights in Yucaipa Regional Park, during the day it was too hot, We were most of the time in the cooking area and occasionally We went to the tent to get our stuff and the tent was a bit hot because there was no shade or anything, which was just normal,  but at night it was just perfect, we left one windows open to have some air flow and we slept like babies.\n\n~ We are 5 in the family, so this tent was just perfect, there was enough room for all of us (2 queen mattresses) and still plenty of space to put our clothes/luggage, sleeping bags, etc.\n~ I really like the materials, it has two entrances so we used the sided one, We also put a heavy duty tarp on the bottom of the tent to protect it, I bought a 6' x 8\ngreen grass rug and on top of that an Easy up (Canopie) and it was a perfect setup.\n\n~Overall a great experience no complaints or anything, We are just very happy with this investment, Can't wait to go camping in the next few weeks!",

      "description": "Come join me for this \"Looks & Features\" video tour on this 2007 Regal Express cruiser. We start at the starboard bow noting the fore deck features such as the covered windlass, deck wash-down and spotlight. Moving aft note the large forward and side windows which brightens up the cabin's interior. We got a full Camper Canvass enclosure, to offer year around protection. At the transom we check out the dinghy ( which may be included), storage and other features on this part of the deck.\nOnce aboard, we can see the bi-level cockpit and note the fold-a-way transom seating.\nAt the helm we get the \"captain's view \" from the command center and can easily see all of the controls are with in easy reach of the pilot.\nWe enter the cabin thru a \"smoky\" opaque door with a full screen underneath. To port we have a galley with a hidden glass top stove which is covered when not in use for lots of counter space.\nRegal has used upgraded materials here with a textured upholstery on the seating area; has finished the floor so you can remove the carpet and has a solid wood table that lowers into the deck with the push of a button to form the forward sleeping area. The head is remarkably large for this size vessel: besides the vac-u-Flush system, it has  separate shower area with curtain to keep the rest of the facility dry. That's a Ladies Like It Feature!\nThe mid cabin is full beam and double wide and the mirrored bulkheads give the impression of roominess. There is lots of storage in the boat: the stairs lift up, there are multiple lockers and the bottom of the sofa has drawers that pull out so you do not have to move the cushions. This vessel has all the amenities: with AC in the cabin, a generator for full power, a well lite cabin and rich furnishings you'll feel right at home!.\nVisit the www.SOUTHMOUNTAINYACHTS.com site now for full specs, lots of photos and all of our fun boats for sale. Give up a call at (949) 842-2344 to find out how you can have this boat today.",

      "description": "VINTAGE EXTINCT ATTRACTIONS DISNEYLAND Frontierland Jelly Belly Candy Shop at Disneyland in California: infaMOUSEproject is mostly Disneyland Rides in California, Frontierland. It is here that we experience the story of our country's past. The color, romance and drama of frontier America as it developed from wilderness trails to roads, riverboats, railroads and civilization. A tribute to the faith, courage and ingenuity of our hearty pioneers who blaze the trails and made this progress possible.\n\n— Walter E. Disney, July 17, 1955\nHistory and environs[edit]\nFrontierland first appeared in Disneyland as one of five original themed lands. Conceived by Walt Disney, the land did not initially contain many attractions, but centered on open expanses of wilderness which could be traversed by guests via stagecoach, pack mules, Conestoga wagon,and walking trails. The Mine Train Thru Nature's Wonderland opened in 1960, consisting of a sedate train ride around various western landscape dioramas. The Mine Train closed in 1977 to make way for a new attraction; the Big Thunder Mountain Railroad, which opened in 1979.\n\nDisneyland's Frontierland gateway is constructed of ponderosa pine logs. The land's long shoreline along the Rivers of America is considered a prime viewing location for the nighttime Fantasmic! show. The docks to both the Mark Twain Riverboat and the Sailing Ship Columbia, (a replica of American explorer Robert Gray's 18th century ship that circumnavigated the globe) are located here, and Tom Sawyer Island in the river's center is also considered a property of Frontierland\n\nOn the roof of the Westward Ho Trading Co., there are elk or deer antlers. Elk antlers were commonly placed on general stores in the old west so cowboys coming into town immediately knew where to get supplies. Also in Frontierland is a building that has a large sign that says \"Laod Bhang Co. Fireworks Factory\". Plus, at the storefront marked \"Crockett and Russel Hat Co.\", you'll find a window honoring Fess Parker, who played Davy Crockett in Walt Disney's Davy Crockett. Frontierland borders Fantasyland (via the Big Thunder Trail), New Orleans Square and Adventureland, and connects to the Central Plaza through an iconic set of fort-style gates.\n\n\n\nAttractions and entertainment[edit]\nBig Thunder Mountain Railroad\nFrontierland Shootin' Exposition\nMark Twain Riverboat\nPirate's Lair on Tom Sawyer Island\nSailing Ship Columbia\nLegends of Frontierland\nFormer attractions and entertainment[edit]\nMike Fink Keel Boats (1955–1997)\nBig Thunder Ranch\nWoody’s Roundup\nLittle Patch of Heaven Petting Farm\nBurning Settler’s Cabin\nCasa de Fritos\nCasa Mexicana\nCeremonial Dance Circle\nConestoga Wagons\nDixieland Band Stand\nFestival of Fools\nFort Wilderness (1956-2003)[1]\nIndian Village\nNature's Wonderland\nRainbow Caverns Mine Traine\nRainbow Ridge Pack Mules\nSilver Banjo Barbecue\nStagecoach Ride\nRestaurants and refreshments[edit]\nThe Golden Horseshoe Cafe\nStage Door Cafe\nRancho del Zocalo Restaurante\nRiver Belle Terrace\nBig Thunder Ranch Barbecue\nFormer restaurants and refreshments[edit]\nMcDonald's in Disneyland\nShops[edit]\nThe Spirit of Pocahontas Shop\nBonanza Outfitters\nWestward Ho Trading Company\nPioneer Mercantile\nSilver Spur",

      "title": "Elkhorn – A Montana Ghost Town HD – near Boulder, Montana MT",
      "description": "Elkhorn, a Montana ghost town in HD, is near Boulder, Montana. \n \nJoin me as I explore Elkhorn ghost town in the southwestern part of our state of Montana.  Silver was initially discovered in the Elkhorn Mountains and over $14 million in silver was carried from the mines in the area. In 1890, the Sherman Silver Purchase Act passed, creating a high demand for Elkhorn's silver.\n\nDuring this peak period, Elkhorn boasted 2,500 inhabitants, a school, hotel, church, stores, saloons, and brothels. Unlike most mining towns, Elkhorn was populated mostly by married European immigrants.  In 1893 the Fraternity Hall was constructed for social gatherings, and still remains as one of the most well-preserved buildings in Elkhorn.\n\nIn the years following, the silver boom and Elkhorn's prosperity began to lessen as the desire for silver decreased. A diphtheria epidemic also struck Elkhorn, resulting in many deaths, particularly of children.  Soon after, railroad service to Elkhorn was halted and only a fraction of the original inhabitants remained.\n\nThis was my second journey to Elkhorn ghost town.  The first expedition was in 2001.  I took a few pictures and made a slideshow https://youtu.be/f8fP7Yglon8   Thinking back, I believe the town had only a couple of hardy souls living there. \n \nBoy was I surprised when I arrived in town.  Not only did I have a flat tire, but many cabins have been renovated and the year-round population is now up to ten!  Most residents are descendants of early miners and shopkeepers. \n \nEveryone I met was extremely friendly and related stories of relatives who worked, built cabins or were buried in the cemetery.\n  \nElkhorn John was the first resident I met.  He lives across the street west from the Elkhorn State Park, the smallest state park in Montana.  The park consists of two buildings, the Gillian Hall and the Fraternity Hall.  \n\nElkhorn John lives in a cabin built by his grandfather in 1892!  He, along with his two friendly dogs, opened up the fire hall and aired up my flat tire.  This did not fix the problem but it did tell us where the rock hole was!  Replacing the flat with my spare was my next project.\n\nI also met Tom and a friend of his.  Tom lives across the street north of the state park.  He assisted me in replacing my flat tire with my spare tire.  His friend actually went looking for a spare when we were having difficulties removing my spare from under the truck.  Tom filled the spare with his portable compressor since it was also low on air (a new tire but had not been checked for air since it was new, six years ago!)\n  \nTom related a few stories about Elkhorn.  As a teenager, he assisted in the Elkhorn Mine delivering dynamite to the blasters (at 500 to 1800 feet underground!)  His grandfather built a cabin on the land where he now lives.  \n\nTom recommended I visit the cemetery and also the old railroad water tower built in 1889 by the Northern Pacific Railroad.  The water tower and short-line railroad from Boulder were active until rail service was discontinued in 1914.  \n\nThe 48,000 gallon water tower is the last-known example of a first-generation Northern Pacific wooden water tank which, because of its 6,000-ft. altitude, included a wooden skirt around the tank supporting structure.\n\nAnother person I met was just leaving the cemetery when I arrived.  She is from Helena and her great grandfather was buried here.  He died during the Diphtheria epidemic that hit the town especially hard from 1884-1889.\n\nNow, THAT’S a lot of history in my short four hour stay in Elkhorn ghost town!  I just wish I had budgeted more time.  The next sojourn will be sooner than 15 years from now, for sure!\n \nThis sequence was captured with a DJI camera on a Phantom 3 Advanced quad copter (aka drone or UAV) and a Canon Vixia HFS-100 camera.

In 2002 there were 44 large air tankers on exclusive use contracts but that number declined over the next 12 years to a low point of 9 in 2013.\n\nHere is the breakdown:\n\nUSFS Multi-year full time exclusive use (14)\nT-118 HC-130H U.S. Forest Service\nT-105 MD-87 Aero Air, LLC\nT-101 MD87 Aero Air, LLC\nT-161 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-160 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-260 CL-415 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-912 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-131 C-130 Coulson\nT-10 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-43 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-06 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-45 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-05 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-07 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-44 P2V Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\n\nUSFS Call When Needed (part time) (9)\nT-911 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-910 DC-10 10 Tanker Air Carrier, LLC\nT-02 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-01 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-41 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-40 BAe-146 Neptune Aviation Services, Inc.\nT-162 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-163 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\nT-164 RJ85 Aero Flite, Inc.\n\nCanadian government (borrowed) (3)\nT-154 CV580 Alberta\nT-173 CV580 Saskatchewan\nT-174 CV580 Saskatchewan\n\nCanadian companies (3)\nT-155 CV580 Conair\nT-142 C-440 Conair\nT-152 CV580 Conair\n\nMAFFS C-130s (4)\nMAFFS 2 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air Force Base\nMAFFS 5 302nd Airlift Wing, Air Force Reserve, Peterson Air Force Base\nMAFFS 1 153rd Airlift Wing, Wyoming Air National Guard\nMAFFS 9 145th Airlift Wing, North Carolina Air National Guard\n\nIt is interesting that Aero Flite has five RJ85s converted, certified, staffed, and actively fighting fires, and Neptune has five BAe-146s doing the same.

New Fire lines were cut and old ones were cleared and widened. Many retardant drops were made above the homes and firefighters spent 24 hours a day keeping watch on our property. In the early hours of 08/20/15 the fire exploded and it looked like our homes would be gone. Firefighters stationed themselves throughout the Villa and watered things down to help keep our property safe. The fire stopped right where the fire line was made and where retardant was dropped. The fire moved its way north. Without all the firefighters and National Guard we would have lost all 100 homes.  The club members and other area residents began serving evening meals to all the fire crews as they changed shifts. As many as 180 firefighters have been fed each evening to thank them for saving our homes and working to get this fire out. The dinners were served for a week starting 08/23/2015.  THANK YOU ALL FIREFIGHTERS !!!\nThanks to The Coleman Brothers for recording the song and Thank You to Judy Kellersberger and Mike Black for writing this great song!!!",

Elinor Dempsey, 54, of Los Osos, was surfing at Morro Strand Park in Morro Bay around 10:15 a.m. when the shark bit her board, leaving a 14-inch wide bite mark. One renowned shark expert said the shark could have been as big as 13 to 15 feet, though he still needs to examine the board for a conclusive measurement.

It does this all the time, but this time, it started a wildfire. That night, I noticed the fire, and started shooting pictures for a timelapse. I didn't know at that time that I'd be doing that for the next four nights and three days.\nIt quieted down and flared back up again several times, but Sunday night, a thunderstorm came through, and finally put it out for good.\n\n\"Shamanistic\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) \nLicensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/\n\nThis timelapse uses these sounds from freesound:\nforest fire by Corsica_S ( http://www.freesound.org/people/Corsica_S/ )\nRainstorm V2 by esh9419 ( http://www.freesound.org/people/esh9419/ )",

      "description": "We are all alone at Kelly Island, just outside the city limits of Missoula, MT.  Serenity surrounds us on this gorgeous weekday in early September.  Located at the confluence of the Bitterroot River and the Clark Fork River, Kelly Island is a day-use area that was reserved just for us.  \n\nThe habitat of this large 648-acre, undeveloped island is a unique mix of cottonwood bottoms, large meadows, and ponderosa pine forests with remarkable wildlife populations.  The air was not as crisp and clear as it normally is in western Montana due to smoke from unprecedented forest fires burning in the Pacific Northwest. \n \nThis area is home to many species of birds and other wildlife. The site is open to the public and is used for day hikes, dog walking and wildlife watching. \n\nKelly Island fishing access site has just been upgraded with paved roads, defined parking, boat launch and restrooms.\n\nPlease see my other video “Stunning Change of Seasons on Kelly Island” captured in October a few years ago:  https://youtu.be/V6i8kR-dc2I\n\nThis sequence was captured with an aerial camera system on a DJI Phantom 3 quad copter, AKA drone or UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle.)

      "description": "I hiked up to Grinnell Glacier Sunday morning, on the way back down I captured this. This is a timelapse I composed from pictures taken at a one second interval between 11:25 AM and noon, on Sunday, August 30, 2015. (Roughly 35 minutes to 1 minute speed-up.) The video pretty much speaks for itself, but the view was stunning. I loved watching the sun cast the clouds' shadows across the valley, and the glancing light across the lake (and even the complex wave patterns on the lake's surface [it was realllllly windy that day]). The music is \"Wind Guide You\" from the Skyrim soundtrack.\n\nP.S. Yes, I know screwed up the title on the video. It's \"Grinnell\" and it was Sunday, August 30th not 31st.",

Of that figure, twenty-five (25) are males, thirty-eight (38) females and forty-six (46) children.\n\nThe evacuation process will continue early on Monday 31 August 2015. Those who wish to evacuate, as this is not a mandatory order, are asked to gather at the area of the Roman Catholic Church and Morne Towpis to facilitate transfer with priority consideration given to children, elderly and the physically challenged.\n\nFamily members in Roseau and environs are asked to receive evacuated residents at the Dominica Grammar School. Residents with no family accommodation will be provided for them at the Dominica Grammar School.\n\nFamily members in Roseau and environs are also asked to contact the Emergency Operations Office at Tel: 767-266-3148/3221 for further information.\n\nGovernment continues to ensure that the welfare of citizens of all affected communities is safeguarded.

Issues of resettlement now up for discussion to cover schools, etc. PM Skerrit also mentions Dubique in the assessment stating that all residents of Dubique do not wish to return. PM Skerrit said that the State would take full responsibility to provide for those dramatically affected. Jungle Bay hotel was affected severely. PM Skerrit said the proprietor of the hotel said he would need to find a new site for the construction of a new hotel. The main Douglas-Charles airport has been affected. Estimated cost to restore is $39.4 million. All equipment at Douglas-Charles airport destroyed. Infrastructure (roads, bridges only) damage tallied at $612.7 million. Clearance of usable roads will cost $12 million. Agriculture is still being assessed as limited access to farms in Delices and Boetica. Infrastructure - a team from the World Bank is on the ground assessing...they are expected to prepare an independent assessment of damage to infrastructure.",

On Thursday night, Ettinoffe provided a report on water supply, as it stands, one week post Tropical Storm Erika. Tropical Storm Erika devastated several villages on Dominica by unleashing over 10 inches of rainfall which caused landslides and in excess of 30 are presumed dead.\n\nPrior to Erika, 98% of the island had potable water. T.S. Erika affected 100% of water supply. To date, water to 70% of population of Dominica restored. Indiscriminate use of fire hydrants to clean roads, driveways of concern to water supply company; appealing to communities to cease this practice. \n\nNo word on restoration of water supply to the community of Coulibistrie. Supply to the community of Grand Bay has been affected. Only 35% of the community in that area receiving water supply. Water supply to the community of Calibishie should be restored by Saturday September 5.\n\nAreas where no progress: Bagatelle, Fond St. Jean, Petite Savanne, Dubique. Access is a problem. Delices and Boetica have no damage to lines, restoration likely in two days time. Colihaut, Dublanc, Bioche should have water supply restored by September 7.\n\nWater supply to the community of Giraudel affected severely. Work required. Water supply to the communities of Wesley, Woodford Hill, Marigot affected; targeting September 7 to make progress in these areas.\n\nWater supply to Salisbury still affected. Temporary intake being worked on. Villagers offering their assistance. Hoping by September 6, some water supply to Salisbury can be restored.\n\nSewage network damaged in Roseau, Canefield, and Jimit. Pipeline under Bath Estate bridge being replaced; 50% complete. Access to sewage system in the community of Jimit prohibitive. \n\nAsking customers to be patient as restoration is being worked on.",

      "description": "Hurricane Jimena FACE! Hurricane Jimena 2015 is a very large hurricane (about 700 miles across!) I say \"Santiago\" code word for Jimena. Jimena approaching Hawaii on Sep.1, 2015. A sudden spike in cloud seeding aka chemtrails and HAARP activity has been noticed in Hawaii shortly before and during the 2015 Pacific Hurricane season. This artificial cloud cover has been raising temperatures in Hawaii, as well as humidity making the weather unusually hot, muggy, and humid - giving rise and power to these artificially created hurricanes.\n\nHurricane Jimena is expected to miss Hawaii just short of reaching the Big Island! Thank God! and also thanks to the geoengineers for sparing Hawaii!! :) and steering all hurricanes away from Hawaii!!.. so far. Including Hurricane Ignacio, Kilo, and others.\n\nThese storms have been forming just south of the southern tip of Baja California where there's a notoriously secretive Guadalupe Island (Isla de Guadalupe) major HAARP center. This HAARP launches a 'death ray' into the sky, effectively 'zapping' our Planet Earth - Gaia. \n\nThe result of this insane weather experiment is evidence left by it's sheer massive size and power - patterns in the sky that stretch for hundreds of miles South into the spot where Pacific hurricanes are born!\n\nWeather modification through artificial cloud seeding aka chemtrails stimulates the Greenhouse Effect by trapping the evaporating moisture heat under it, while UV rays from the Sun easily penetrate it. HAARP can be used to create earthquakes, change weather patterns, bend the ionosphere, tidal waves, volcanism, and hurricanes, as well as weird patterns in the sky.",

Had to have a laugh at the Costco Boogie Board label on the wrist strap \"Warning, this activity is dangerous\". Yeah, 8'-10' waves fit that bill.",

      "description": "Hurricane Patricia became a super storm due to technological innovations such as HAARP, Chemtrails, and other advanced geo-engineering, weather modification, electromagnetic, and climate control technology of the Amero Union (Canada, US, and Mexico) in 2015.\n\nHurricane Patricia HAARP use is another showmanship of how far the mad scientists are willing to go. Too far! Thus, creating a super storm breaking all records! But is the mainstream media hiding information about what else is going on with the weather at the same time? You bet!\n\nA sudden spike in cloud seeding (aka chemtrails) has been noticed in Hawaii shortly before and during the 2015 Pacific Hurricane season start. These storms have been forming just south of the southern tip of Baja California where there's a notoriously secretive Guadalupe Island (Isla de Guadalupe) major HAARP center. This HAARP launches a 'death ray' into the sky, effectively 'zapping' our Planet Earth - Gaia. The result of this insane weather experiment is evidence left by it's sheer massive size and power - patterns in the sky that stretch for hundreds of miles south into the sport where these Pacific hurricanes are born.\n\nWeather modification through artificial cloud seeding aka chemtrails stimulates the Greenhouse Effect by trapping the evaporating moisture heat under it, while UV rays from the Sun easily penetrate it. HAARP can be used to create earthquakes, change weather patterns, bend the ionosphere, tidal waves, volcanism, and hurricanes, as well as weird patterns in the sky.",

      "description": "At least 111 killed by falling crane at Grand Mosque in Mecca\nAt least 111 people were killed when a crane toppled over at Mecca's Grand Mosque on Friday, Saudi Arabia's Civil Defence authority said, less than two weeks before Islam's annual haj pilgrimage.\n\nAt least 238 people were wounded, Saudi Arabia's Civil Defence body said.\n\n\"All those who were wounded and the dead have been taken to hospital. There are no casualties left at the location,\" General Suleiman al-Amr, director general of the Civil Defence Authority, told al-Ikhbariya television. Strong wind and rains had uprooted trees and rocked cranes in the area, he said.\n\nA statement by a spokesman for the administration of the mosques in Mecca and Medina said the crane smashed into the part of the Grand Mosque where worshippers circle the Kaaba - the black-clad cube towards which the world's 1.6 billion Muslims face to pray.\n\nPictures circulating on social media showed pilgrims in bloodied robes and debris from a part of the crane that appeared to have crashed through a ceiling.\n\nSaudi authorities go to great lengths to prepare for the millions of Muslims who converge on Mecca to perform the sacred pilgrimage. Last year, they reduced the numbers permitted to make the haj pilgrimage on safety grounds because of construction work to enlarge the Grand Mosque.\n\nThe haj, one of the largest religious gatherings in the world, has been prone to disasters in the past, mainly from stampedes as pilgrims rush to complete rituals and return home. Hundreds of pilgrims died in such a crush in 2006.\n\nSaudi authorities have since spent vast sums to expand the main haj sites and improve Mecca's transport system, in an effort to prevent more disasters.\n\nSecurity services often ring Islam's sacred city with checkpoints and other measures to prevent people arriving for the pilgrimage without authorization.\n\nThose procedures, aimed at reducing crowd pressure which can lead to stampedes, fires and other hazards, have been intensified in recent years as security threats grow throughout the Middle East.",

      "description": "The video footage shows a river of hail running through the desert following a storm on November 16, 2015. It has been named as the 'sand river'. As per the online reports, heavy rains over the past few weeks triggered floods that killed dozens of people in Iraq and caused widespread damage in Egypt, Israel, Jordan and Saudi Arabia.                                      In arid environments, it is common for flash floods to travel rapidly downstream to areas which usually do not receive any rainfall. So, the river appears in the downstream area despite any local indication of the rainfall. Reportedly, in this case, the illusion is compounded by the fact that a significant hail has fallen upstream.",

      "description": "This time-lapse video shows the lightning-caused Spruce Fire burning through mature, lodgepole pine forest. Much of the fire is burning through accumulated dead and downed trees and other vegetation (white smoke). When the fire picks up enough energy to climb into the tops of the trees, the smoke becomes black. You can see isolated torching of groups of trees in the beginning of the video and then a crown run, with visible flames, towards the end of the video. Some areas burn hotter and more intense, others areas are skipped entirely, leaving pockets of unburned vegetation. This \"mosaic\" pattern of burning is typical in wildland fires.\n\nFire has shaped the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem for thousands of years. Fire promotes habitat diversity by removing forest overstory and helps return nutrients to the soil more quickly. Learn more at http://www.nps.gov/yell/learn/nature/fireconsequences.htm.",

The raging brown floodwaters spawned from Tropical Storm Etau, which has dumped 60 centimeters (2 feet) of rain over some areas since Monday. Combine that with several weeks of near-daily rainfall, and Ibaraki and Tochigi prefectures are now deluged and unrecognizable. \"Tochigi Prefecture is facing a grave danger and is in an emergency situation,\" Japan Meteorological Agency Spokesman Takuya Deshimaru said. \"It is experiencing unprecedented downpour.\"\nMore than 170,000 people have been evacuated, officials said. Those who didn't leave found their houses submerged within minutes. The latest evacuation advisory came for the city of Sendai, where more than 200,000 residents in three wards were warned they may need to leave their homes due to rising water.\nMembers of the Japanese Self Defense Forces dropped from helicopter lines to pluck stranded residents from their roofs. Two by two, they swung precariously over the raging currents as they were pulled back up to the aircraft.\nThe Self Defense Forces had rescued 101 people by Thursday afternoon, a spokesman said.\nIbaraki prefecture said 70 people out of the 176 there who had called for help had been rescued.\nAdditionally, local firefighters rescued 20 people, an official from Joso City's Information Office said. Nine people were reported missing in that city, authorities said.",

There was no smoke or ash coming our way, and there were no sirens or air support nearby, so we honestly didn't know how close it was. Once we drove up out of our gulch, we realized how close it was. There were no sirens or air support because there was zero firefighting effort in Anderson Springs. (This is NOT a dig at the firefighters, by the way! There was just way too much fire in every direction, and they didn't have the resources to send to Anderson Springs. I have no hard feelings against the firefighters, they were busy risking their lives elsewhere! Anderson Springs) So anyway, that is how we ended up leaving WAY too late.

      "description": "I was in Cobb at a house we own when the Valley Fire erupted on September 12, 2015 less than four miles away.  The wind was gusting 20 miles an hour for much of the day and lots of pine cones and needles had been raining down.  Looking up into the trees I saw how stressed many of them were from years of drought and an infestation of beetles.  Not realizing the extent and rapidity of the fire's spread, I stayed in Cobb until 5:30 pm, and found my way down blocked in all but one direction.  It sounded at times like a battle zone with helicopters overhead and explosions from bursting propane tanks and pine trees.  The high winds broadcast burning embers in every direction, making it very difficult for any kind of effort to contain the explosive growth of the inferno.  Firefighters had to make difficult choices about which houses to defend. It is hard to grasp the absolute devastation to our extended community.  So far I've not been able to get into the area to see what is left, but we assume our house and many more in the area are gone.",

      "description": "This is footage of the Valley Fire in Lake County CA 2015. I brought the family over the Hopland grade then into Clearlake Oaks to the Moose Lodge. The Red Cross had tried to bully their way in, which was happening alot unfortunately. They threatened to shut camps down if Red Cross wasn't allowed to take over, then they don'y help with clothes and other things, only food, and they are the first to stand in line for food themselves. I saw many facebook posts of personal stories that aligned with this type of behavior, sad. I noticed none of those stories made it to the news. We brought clothes, water, blankets, and kids toys. I didn't take footage of the camp because I thought it may be embarrassing to those staying there as it was chaos and sadness. I have several friends that lost everything to this devastating fire. I thought it was important to see first hand what was happening, and for my kids to see it and feel what it was like to see something like this and be able to help, if only a little. The video does not do justice the experience we had, seeing melted cars in between the houses down the sidestreets, the burnt smell, black hills right behind all the businesses and houses, all the emergency workers, a huge sense of loss in general.  Anyway I added the music to enhance the effect, and my actual narration I feel is terrible.  I hope these people get back on track soon and return to life as they knew it.",

      "description": "From typhoon Soudelor, I've come to realize that when it comes to typhoon/hurricane day, people in Taiwan actually don't stay coped up at home waiting for winds and rain to pass. They, on  the contrary, utilize the day to help out the economy by shopping, going to movies and dining out. I guess typhoons/hurricanes just happened way too often that the people are immune to the danger this nature could bring.\n\nBut I can't help but blame those greedy business people who authorize their employees to risk the safety coming into work on typhoon days in order to make extra cash. It's because the malls and the theatres are opened that draw the people out or they would have be content staying home watching TV! This would therefore save the government a lot of troubles since there would also be fewer accidents on the road.\n\nAnyway, thanks for watching! xx stay safe!\n\nFind Me Elsewhere!\nYoutube https://www.youtube.com/c/IrisViruss\nTwitter https://twitter.com/irisyatingyu\nInstagram https://www.instagram.com/yatingphotography/",

(Supplied: Japan Meteorological Agency)\n\nWaves crashed along the east coast and the capital Taipei was swept with wind and rain.\n\nAt 9:00pm local time (11:00pm AEST) Dujuan was 30 kilometres south-east of central Taichung city, the Central Weather Bureau said.\n\nThe bureau said \"virtually the whole island\" was at risk of severe wind and rain, with authorities warning downpours could trigger landslides.\n\n\"It picked up speed in the past few hours, but will slow somewhat after hitting the mountains in the east,\" an official from the bureau said.\n\nDujuan made landfall in the northern county of Yilan, where some areas have seen more than 500 millimetres of rain in the last 24 hours.\n\nPanicked visitors to the island's east — many of whom had headed there for the Mid-Autumn Festival long weekend — crammed onto trains away from the eastern cities of Hualien and Taitung before services were suspended.\n\nHigh-speed rail services in the west were also cancelled.\n\nAuthorities warned that coastal areas could be particularly dangerous as tides are affected by the current \"supermoon\" — a rare astrological event in which the moon appears brighter and larger.\n\nThis is because the moon has reached its closest orbital point to Earth and therefore has a stronger gravitational pull than usual.\n\nThe storm intensified as it approached Taiwan, with gusts of 227 kilometres per hour.",

      "description": "A typhoon struck mainland China on Tuesday after lashing Taiwan, where it killed two, injured hundreds and left hundreds of thousands without power or water.\n\nTyphoon Dujuan passed through Taiwan for three hours on Monday night, bringing high winds and rain. Several domestic and international flights and trains were suspended as the storm approached.\n\nTaiwan's Central News Agency, citing the government's emergency operations center, said Tuesday that the typhoon had left two people dead, 324 injured and six mountain climbers missing. A total of 710,000 households were without electricity and 370,000 without water.\n\nBon Jovi canceled concerts planned for Monday and Tuesday in Taiwan because of the storm, which were to be the first ones there by the American rock band in 20 years, event promoter Live Nation Taiwan said on Facebook. Bon Jovi had added the second date in Taiwan earlier this month along with a new concert in Bangkok after performances in Beijing and Shanghai were abruptly canceled, reportedly over the band's inclusion of a picture of the Dalai Lama in a video that angered Chinese authorities.\n\nTyphoon Dujuan made landfall in southeastern Fujian province Tuesday morning, packing maximum wind speeds of 119 kilometers per hour (74 mph) near its center, before weakening into a tropical storm, according to the National Meteorological Center.

Earlier in the evening, our host building -- Commissioner's House at the National Museum of Bermuda -- took a direct hit to the roof, part of which was destroyed. Our camera pole appeared to fall to the roof floor, only giving us a view inside the now open roof space. Screaming winds of 60+ mph continued to rage and amazingly, our equipment continued to stream both video and audio. This is what you see a glimpse of here!\n\nExtent of the damage is unknown at this time but could be severe.

      "description": "Hurricane Joaquin's heavy weather arrived (Oct.2015) with three days straight of heavy rain, that caused flooding. We live in the area of the Waccamaw River (SC) and we had some flooding ourselves, but not as terrible as those that live right on the river.\n\nOnce the rain and water subsided and the first rays of sunlight shined through, we opened up our crawl space to let air get to it, checked for damages around the house and under.\n\nWhile we were busy with that, Sara, our beagle, ran up under the house and wouldn’t come out. She was barking and yelling the entire time.\n\nInto an hour of her barking, my husband finally decided to check it out. She ignored any demands from him. \n\nOver the course of an hour, she finds a way to get under the porch, still under the house. She barked until my son came home from work; which was about an hour. He was the only one that could fit inside the small box like hole where she was. When he finally got to her, he brought her out, but also found something else …three little kittens.\n\nWe do not know where the mother is. We plan on keeping them.\n\nPlease subscribe to stay up to date with their story. I'm sure they'd love that!",

The key is conserving energy, and using every possible advantage, natural or man-made, to get you to the destination. The 2nd km was easier and then it was a wild downwind run in blown out conditions. \n\nSometimes it is the journey that is more memorable than the destination...",

We call it the Cape D'Ag run and “Our little piece of Maui”.\n\nSpeeds vary considerably depending on which way the tide is running.. On this day it was running against us and with a 19 knot  / 35kph / 22mph easterly wind, the runners were hard to get into.\n\nBoard: SIC F16v3\n3rd Person Mount\nGoPro 4 Black",

      "description": "This video shows the second 2/3rds of the 10.4 km / 6.5 mile Lamma Island - Cheung Chau (L2CC) downwinding Run from Kat Tsai Wan near the Lamma Power Power Station to the Po Yu Wan on the SW Tip of Cheung Chau Island. This is the first time this route was tried by SUP on Dec 5, 2015 in winds gusting to 30 knot, 55kph, 34 mph. The beginning of the run is in the lee of the wind and the waves start out relatively groomed and lined up. Very quickly they start to grow and by 1/2 way are joined with ground swell that sweeps round from the Southern Side of Lamma. This is challenging run at the end, where the start is only reachable by boat. Whilst there is relatively little shipping between Lamma and Cheung Chau it is still necessary to be aware of ships, and a safety boat is recommended. Boards used in this crossing are a SIC Maui F16v3 and SIC Bullet 14v1 TWC. Leashes, and PFDs worn. PLBs, Phones and whistles carried.",

Hundreds of roads were closed, many bridges washed out, government offices closed, curfews in effect to keep motorists away from dangerous floods. Most rivers are well above flood stage. As you might expect from watching this channel, rain usually brings fossil hunting success so I have been itching to get out for days and collect. I knew there had to be some really good stuff exposed in my favorite creeks, so I hit one of them today and it was a home run. The entire thing has been swept clean and the bottom changed completely. Teeth were exposed everywhere! I found angustidens, mako, and even a rare megalodon tooth - my first complete big one from this site ever.",

      "description": "It was a very windy day at West Loch's Chocolate Beach all day as the approaching Storm Oho was just upgraded this morning to Hurricane status. I decided to use whole Blue Pincher Crab as my dominant bait for today. I brought frozen crabs, and squid for bait for my crab nets so i could replenish my frozen crabs for live crabs. Today my bowling partner Alric Kutara joined me for a relaxing day of fishing.\n\nAfter baiting my all Penn rig (Battalion rod with a Fierce 5K reel spooled with Power Pro 30lb Spectra braid) with a whole frozen Blue Pincher Crab an estimated 30lb White Trevally Jack (known as an Ulua in Hawaii) violently swallowed the whole crab bait and took off. The hit was extremely powerful! The rod came crashing down on the initial hit and looked like it was going to snap in 2. By the time i got to the rod the fish was covering a lot of ground swimming at a high rate of speed. \n\nThe fish tried to run the mangroves to shake off the hook. I had to set the reel to max drag to pull it out, almost ripped the rod out of my hand. All this time the fish was changing directions & i could feel it shaking it's head. It was all i could do just to reel in the slacked line as the fish's speed was impressive running in only 4-5ft. Finally the fish spun around and came directly at me. It dove under the pier i was standing on and busted the 30lb Spectra main line after it snagged like it was nothing.\n\nWhen the fish ran at me i looked down and saw how large it was through that silty water when it shot underneath me for a split second. The length was roughly 4ft and the body was thick. The back was upright and blueish/white. This fish was hooked before. It knew that either running the mangroves or going under the pier would most likely cut the line. It knew this because that's exactly what it did as it was obviously hooked before and knew how to escape. Smart fish!\n\nThis is the 3rd GT i've hooked here, all using whole crab as bait. Alric had a blast participating in this short fight and now he wants his turn at catching a big fish. Goes to show the CRAB WORKS BABY!",

      "title": "Powerful Super Typhoon Koppu Bringing Life-Threatening Flooding, Damaging Winds to Philippines",
      "description": "Super Typhoon Koppu will put lives and property across Luzon Island of the Philippines in danger through early next week.\n\nKoppu developed into a typhoon early Friday morning local time and is currently approaching the northern Philippines. Disruptive wind shear had prevented Koppu from any significant strengthening through Thursday; however, Koppu has moved into an area of low wind shear prior to its expected landfall in Luzon late Saturday evening or Sunday morning, allowing it to strengthen into a super typhoon. With the increased strength, Koppu remains a very dangerous cyclone as it moves through Luzon this weekend.\n\n\"Rapid intensification is likely to occur right before Koppu reaches Luzon,\" stated AccuWeather Meteorologist Adam Douty on Friday. \"Koppu will be the equivalent of a Category 4 hurricane by landfall.\"\nIn addition to Koppu's increased strength as it approached the Philippines, the system also has slowed down significantly. The combination of a powerful and slow-moving typhoon could spell a disastrous situation for residents and communities in its path, which will be northern Luzon Island in Koppu's case.\n\nKoppu crawled toward towards northern Luzon Island throughout the day Saturday, local time. Koppu is expected to make landfall around midnight, Sunday morning, local time, and then slowly begin to turn northward. How quickly Koppu tracks north will determine the duration of life-threatening conditions for northern Luzon.\nWhile damaging winds are a concern, the greatest threat will be life-threatening flooding from days of torrential rainfall.\n\n\"A total of 300 to 600 mm (12 to 24 inches) of rain is expected to be widespread,\" stated Douty. There will even be localized amounts upwards or in excess of 900 mm (36 inches). Such rain is sure to trigger severe and life-threatening flooding and mudslides.\n\n\"The most significant rain will fall in the mountainous terrain of northern Luzon,\" added Douty.\n\nResidents in Baguio, Bangui, Aparri, Tuguegarao and Pagudpud are among those across northern Luzon who are being urged to prepare for the impending severe flood danger. Heed all evacuation orders and begin making plans to seek shelter away from areas prone to flooding and mudslides.",

Foremost of these towns is Casiguran, which is isolated due to landslides.\n\nAuthorities said no casualty has been recorded in the province so far as they hope for the best in line with the 'zero casualty' goal.",

I had wanted to make a before and after video. When I started the video it was so nice outside I never even mentioned a typhoon was coming. When I started rearranging the plants I never thought typhoon Lando would effect my project. As you see the weather looked beautiful. I never thought the weather could change so rapidly as to effect my project and provide me with a weather video. The arranging did not get completed before the typhoon hit. In fact it will take four days before it is completed, we are finishing it today. Typhoons are amazing storms, the larger typhoons are much like hurricanes are in the USA. The big difference is the Philippines experiences about 20 per year,\n\n\nMy retirement in the Philippines began in Sept 6, 2012. I filled a backpack with drawing/art material to write and headed overseas to live a dream. I play and make videos of my life in the Philippines. My life overseas has been the adventure of my lifetime. This Vlog of life here is for my memories and show my friends and family back in the USA the Filipino lifestyle and show the world the joy of overseas retirement..",

The off and on typhoon rains prevented the immediate cleanup that was planned. \n\nMyra was cleaning her outdoor kitchen. It did get quit dirty and full of leaves. She is ready to do a few breakfast videos now. We have talked about it and it might be fun to occasionally do a breakfast video and talk about the day while Myra cooks. Don't know for sure. It is in the thinking stage stage now.\n\nJesse came over and was peeking through the security bars talking to us. We have another video of Jesse talking about foods and we mention a few things we miss over here in the Philippines\n  \nTyphoon rains and wind are very strange too me.

A lot of the strength was unleashed on more eastern provinces but as you can see from this footage she was certainly still packing a fair punch by the time she made her way over to us.

      "description": "Tens of thousands of people have protested against changes to the Philippines' constitution proposed by President Joseph Estrada. \n\n\n\nThe president says he wants to change the constitution to attract more foreign investment but the protestors say that sets a dangerous precedent for more political amendments to be made. \n\n\n\nThe wife of former President Benigno Aquino addressed the protestors at a rally in the capital Manila after protestors marched through the city's financial district.\n\n\n\nProtestors burn an effigy of President Joseph Estrada in the heart of Manila's financial district, Makati.\n\n\n\nTwenty-five-thousand people gathered to protest in Manila and another 50-thousand around the country.\n\n\n\nThe Makati demonstration was reminiscent of the People Power phenomenon that\n\ndeposed President Ferdinand Marcos in 1986. \n\n\n\nThen, protestors also had the backing of both the former President Corazon Aquino and Catholic church leaders.\n\n\n\nBut this time, protesters acknowledged that the issues are much less clear since Estrada, who won a landslide victory just 15 months ago, still remains highly popular. \n\n\n\nDemonstrators object to changes Estrada has proposed to the country's constitution, which the president says is too protectionist and discourages much-needed foreign investment. \n\n\n\nThe protestors fear the planned economic amendments might lead to politicians making other changes to the constitution, such as revisions by members of Congress to extend their terms in office.\n\n\n\nCorazon Aquino, the wife of the former president and former leader herself, and the protestors say they want to prevent a slip back into dictatorship before it occurs.\n\n\n\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\n\n\"The issue is not whether the president can extract a promise from a Constituent Congress not to tinker outside the economic provisions. The concern is whether they will define the economic to include everything that is to their advantage.\"\n\nSUPER CAPTION: Corazon Aquino, former Philippines president\n\n\n\nThe issue of constitutional change has sharply divided Filipinos and has also dented the financial markets. \n\n\n\nEarlier in the week, stocks slumped to a six-month low while the country's currency, the peso, hit a nine-month low. \n\n\n\nStocks, however, later made up some of their losses.\n\n\n\nSimilar rallies to the one in Manila the first mass protests against Estrada - were also held in Cebu, Davao, Baguio, Bacolod, Iligan and other cities. \n\n\n\nCritics also claim that Estrada is attempting to silence a critical press and has allowed a return of cronyism, in which close presidential friends receive special favours. \n\n\n\nEstrada has denied the accusations and insists that he only wants to lessen the divisions between rich and poor by drawing foreign investment to Philippines' money chests. \n\n\n\nSOUNDBITE: (English)\n\n\"We need to adjust our constitution with global realities. The constitution that we have was framed in a different time where the economy of nations was based on protectionism and where competition was not as intense as it is today.\"\n\nSUPER CAPTION: Joseph Estrada, Philippines president\n\n\n\nThe adjustments would lift the bar preventing foreigners from owning land and would allow them to own more than 40 percent of important businesses. \n\n\n\nIt's those restrictions which Estrada says are causing the Philippines to lose out on investment to its neighbours.\n\n\n\nHis proposed changes are generally backed by big business, but some smaller companies fear they may be overwhelmed by foreign competition. \n\n\n\nThe amendments have have also split the Catholic church. \n\n\n\nWhile church leaders helped organize Friday's protests, more than a (m) million members of a large Catholic charismatic group, El Shaddai, held a rival rally in Manila.\n\n\n\nIt celebrated the 60th birthday of its leader, Mike Velarde, who is Estrada's spiritual adviser.\n\n\n\nAquino and Catholic Church officials led rallies two years ago which forced the\n\nthen-President Fidel Ramos to halt constitutional amendments aimed at extending his term.",

The depression continued to strengthen and became Hurricane Patricia Wednesday night.\nPatricia has been making an influence on Latin America since Sunday, as it helped to provide moisture to Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras and Nicaragua. San Jose, Guatemala, reported more than 387 mm (15.25 inches) of rain Sunday through Wednesday.",

No hay un huracán en todo el planeta en toda la historia que haya llegado en la velocidad de sus vientos a 325 kilómetros por hora, afirmó el director de la Comisión Nacional del Agua (Conagua), Roberto Ramírez.\n \nEste meteoro es \"sumamente violento\" y \"puede ser muy catastrófico\", afirmó en una conferencia de prensa la mañana de este viernes.\n \nEl ojo de Patricia tiene un diámetro de 10 kilómetros. En el transcurso de la próxima hora, seguirá internándose en el sur de Jalisco. Los efectos de vientos de huracán y oleaje elevado son extremadamente peligroso y alcanzan también a Colima.\n \nSe recomienda a la navegación marítima menor, localizada en las cercanías del sistema, no realizar actividades náuticas, turísticas, recreativas y comerciales en el mar y zonas costeras, durante las próximas horas.\n \nDebido a que las precipitaciones recientes reblandecieron el suelo, podrían registrarse deslaves, deslizamientos de laderas, desbordamientos de ríos y arroyos o afectaciones en caminos y tramos carreteros, así como inundaciones en zonas bajas y saturación de drenajes en sitios urbanos.",

Winds of 200 mph were measured earlier, and the Hurricane Center labeled Patricia as the \"strongest hurricane on record\" in the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific Basins.\n\nMexico has not formally requested help from the U.S., but State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Friday that America \"stands up to offer any assistance that we can in the aftermath of what at least appears to be a pretty epic event in terms of the intensity and size of the storm.\"",

Winds of 200 mph were measured earlier, and the Hurricane Center labeled Patricia as the \"strongest hurricane on record\" in the Atlantic and eastern North Pacific Basins.\n\nMexico has not formally requested help from the U.S., but State Department spokesman Mark Toner told reporters Friday that America \"stands up to offer any assistance that we can in the aftermath of what at least appears to be a pretty epic event in terms of the intensity and size of the storm.\"",

Now, as the strongest hurricane ever measured—with 200 mph sustained winds—Patricia is just hours from making landfall in Mexico.\nThe National Hurricane Center, with official forecasting responsibility for the Atlantic and eastern Pacific, all but ran out of words to describe the storm’s ferocity, labeling it “potentially catastrophic” and “incredible.” On Twitter, professional weather watchers went a step further, marveling at the storm’s record-breaking ability and fearing for Mexico’s coastal cities. Such a scenario—a quickly strengthening storm of unprecedented strength headed straight for land—is the stuff of meteorologists’ nightmares.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Patricia was a strong Category 5 hurricane—after strengthening from just tropical storm strength a day earlier. Still, calling Patricia a Category 5 underestimates just how ferocious this storm is.\n\nPatricia is headed for a landfall between Manzanillo and Puerto Vallarta on Mexico’s southwest coast on Friday. The storm threatens to be the strongest ever to hit Mexico’s Pacific coast, surpassing a 1959 hurricane that also ranks as the deadliest in that part of the Pacific. As it moves inland, Patricia is expected to produce up to two feet of rain in Mexico’s coastal mountain range, creating a risk of flooding and mudslides over a vast area including Guadalajara, the country’s second-largest city.\n\nAs of Friday morning, Mexico is scrambling to prepare for Patricia. Three states—Jalisco, Colima, and Nayarit—have declared states of emergency. In Colima, officials handed out sandbags. Nearly 400,000 people are in the storm’s path.",

Breaking records with over 200 mph winds for the strongest hurricane to make landfall in the America’s, Hurricane Patricia was a force to be reckoned with on Mexico’s Pacific coast this past Friday October 23rd. Having escalated to a Category 5 hurricane in less than 4 days and making the record for the lowest pressure in any Pacific hurricane, Patricia made landfall near the town of Cuixmala, Jalisco, more than a 100 miles from Puerto Vallarta",

      "description": "Cyclone Chapala is headed for an extremely rare landfall at hurricane strength along the coast of war-torn Yemen late Monday or early Tuesday (mainland U.S. time). While wind damage will be a threat near the point of landfall, the bigger concern will be extremely heavy rainfall in a normally arid region, leading to life-threatening flash floods in a country already suffering a major humanitarian crisis stemming from years of violent conflict.\n\nAccording to the India Meteorological Department, the agency sanctioned by the World Meteorological Organization for issuing official tropical cyclone bulletins for the Arabian Sea, the center of Chapala was located about 50 miles (80 kilometers) south-southwest of Al Mukalla, Yemen, as of 7 p.m. EST Monday, or 3 a.m. Tuesday Yemen time.\n\nAt that time, IMD estimated the cyclone's maximum sustained winds at 75 mph (120 kph) while the U.S. military's Joint Typhoon Warning Center estimated them at 85 mph (140 kph). Either way, Chapala was a Category 1 equivalent storm on the Saffir-Simpson Hurricane Wind Scale as it closed in on the coast of Yemen's mainland on the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe IMD forecast calls for Chapala's core of hurricane-force winds to graze Yemen's fifth largest city, the coastal, war-ravaged port of Al Mukalla, with a population of roughly 300,000. Landfall is expected to the southwest of that city near the border between the governorates of Hadramaut and Shabwah.\n\nOn Sunday, the eye of Chapala passed north of the Yemeni island of Socotra, where flooding rain and damaging winds were reported. The island has likely not experienced a cyclone of hurricane-equivalent intensity since 1922.",

      "description": "Tropical Cyclone Chapala is barreling toward Yemen's coast, bringing the threat of fierce winds and potentially several times the amount of rain that the impoverished country usually gets in an entire year.\n\nThe storm -- the second strongest ever recorded in the Arabian Sea -- is expected to make landfall on Yemen's central coast Tuesday.\n\nChapala was already dumping light to medium rain in Al Mukalla, where wave heights swelled between 1-4 meters (3-13 feet). The storm was some 117 kilometers (72 miles) south of the port city early Tuesday local time.\n\nChapala was packing maximum sustained winds of 195 kph (120 mph) Monday, but was expected to weaken somewhat as it gets closer to the dry air of the Arabian Peninsula.\n\nThe storm is still forecast to pack a punch when it hits Yemen with the strength of a Category 1 hurricane. The major concern is the extraordinary volume of rain it's going to dump on the country's dry, rugged terrain.",

      "description": "The following information was passed on to activist @jamilahanan by the neighbour of the family who were injured in the video (who Jamila knew prior to the incident): On 4th November 2015 at 8.45 am, the Saudi led coalition airstrikes hit a strawberry farm in the village of Safia Tamesh in the Sanhan region, Sana'a Governorate, Yemen, where a poor family were picking strawberries to earn a living. 9 people were reported to have been injured, of which 2 were women and 4 were children. 2 of the injured children were reported as seriously injured. Apparently the rocket was clearly seen fired from a plane by most of the villagers due to the time that it was dropped in the morning. In the video the children are about to be driven to the hospital shortly after the incident. The man is repeatedly saying 'they striked in the middle of strawberry farm' and he also says to the children 'don't be scared, God shall take our revenge'. The neighbour also sent photos of the crater in the field after the airstrike, commenting that it was a surprise that nobody died.",

      "description": "Catamaran Sail & Snorkel in Nassau Bahamas... Tropical Storm Kate Edition!! (11/10/2015)\n\nGoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition 1080p 60fps Protune CAM RAW WIDE FOV (50% Speed)\nColor Corrected in GoPro Studio 2.5\n\nThe songs \"Sand Castles\" by \"The Green Orbs\", The Bluest Star\" by \"The 126ers\" and \"Suns Rise\" by \"Silent Partner\" provided by YouTube Audio (https://www.youtube.com/audiolibrary/music)\n\nSnorkeling starts @1:29\n\nThis is some footage from our catamaran sail & snorkel Nassau Bahamas excursion while traveling on the Carnival Fascination cruise ship... hugely hilarious back story later. This was mine and my wife's 17th wedding anniversary and my Daughter and Son in Law's honeymoon... we decided to go on a cruise together and had a blast. We were heading straight for tropical storm Kate as it was passing Nassau and really thought our day in Nassau was going to be ruined. When we arrived that morning the storm had moved out and away and the weather was perfect. The only noticeable affect was that the water was slightly hazy, but still managed to get some incredible footage. The ride out to the reef was fantastic and when we arrived at the reef I was so excited to get in the water. We saw lots of species of fish, rays, coral etc (some included in this videos). I will be posting a fish only video later that will highlight the many fish we saw. On the way back from the reef we indulged in the complementary rum punch that seemed to flow endlessly. Needless to saw, by the time we got back to the dock we were felling mighty good. Now for the back story....\n\nWhen we were exiting the ship in Nassau they stated the requirement a photo ID as well as your sail and sign card and my wife and I had left our licenses in our room safe. My wife, daughter and son in law exited the ship and I immediately ran back to my room to get our licenses with our excursion tickets in hand. I was in such a hurry that I got flustered and mis-remembered our room number. I must have ran the length of the ship four times trying to find my room until I came to ours. I then had to locate my wife's wallet and I am terrible at looking for things. I came to the apparent  realization that I was going to miss the excursion, but right then I found my wife's wallet and was off again to find the ship's gangway exit.. had to slow down to keep from hyperventilating. Found the exit, but it was not our original exit and started getting panicky again. I pass the second exit and my wife saw me and we began our long trek up to the docks and for those that have been there know how long it is. I made it to the main entrance to Nassau and saw no transports so I really thought we were done in at that point. I then looked over towards the water and saw a fenced gateway leading to a catamaran so I ran over to see if it was ours and it was! I waited briefly for my wife and then she said, \"Do you have the tickets?\" In all the hustle and bustle I had left our tickets in our room when looking for my wife's wallet. Fortunately we left them our ship and room information and they were able to verify that we had paid for the excursion. After all that we were now boarding the catamaran and breathing a large sigh of relief. Now that deserves a huge LMAO!!!",

The ride out to the reef in Nassau Harbor was fantastic and when we arrived at the reef I was so excited to get in the water. The amount of fish and different  species was massive and the surrounding underwater scenery was absolutely beautiful. We only had about 45 min, but I could have stayed out there much longer. I took full advantage of our limited time and captured as much footage as I could and grabbed some really spectacular shots. On the way back from the reef we indulged in the complementary rum punch that seemed to flow endlessly. Needless to saw, by the time we got back to the dock we were felling mighty good...\n\nHere's a list of some of the fish I could identify...\n\nGray Angelfish @0:04\nBlue Parrotfish @0:34\nQueen Parrotfish @0:53\nSouthern Stingray @1:03\nStoplight Parrotfish @1:14\nYellowtail Parrotfish @1:28\nOcean Surgeonfish @1:47, @3:41\nYellow Spotted Stingray @2:04\nGrunt @2:21, @2:38\nSquirrelfish @2:42\nTrumpetfish @3:00\nFrench Angelfish @3:12\nYellowhead Wrasse @3:22\n\nGoPro Hero 3+ Black Edition 1080p 60fps Protune CAM RAW WIDE FOV (Speed 50%)\nColor Corrected in GoPro Studio 2.5\n\nInstrumental acoustic/fingerstyle guitar cover of Under The Sea (The Little Mermaid / Disney) played & arranged by Dave Niskin.

We counted at least 25 different shark, at a certain point we were surrounded, no need to move they were everywhere! The drone shows 8 sharks in a very small area: they were feeding! The best part was that this tour was about to be cancelled for bad weather, and yes the sun was not out, the wind was blowing, the swell was big...but sometimes you have to take your chances...we did and we were rewarded with a memorable day!\n\nAlthough I wasn't able to catch them on video, on this same day we run across mobula mantas (evil rays), turtles, sea lions and further at distance in the background there were humpback whales breaching out of the water! All in one day, all in one tour!\n\n-----\n-----\n\n\nCabo Trek your BEST option for \"High quality tours in Cabo San Lucas\"\n\n\nhttp://www.cabotrek.com\nhttp://www.cabowhaletrek.com\nhttp://www.cabodivetrek.com\n\nBe social, follow and share:\nhttps://www.facebook.com/pages/CaboTr...\nhttps://twitter.com/CaboTrek\nhttps://plus.google.com/+CaboWhaleTre...\n\nHave questions?\nTOLL FREE calls from U.S.: 1-844 851 9842\nFrom Mexico: 624 174 31 60 | 624 123 14 77\n\nEmail: info@cabotrek.com",

The 2 excellent days of diving at the Socorros however which we could enjoy before being chased away by hurricane Sandra defiinitely felt way too short. We retreated into the Sea of Cortez and snorkeled with whale sharks but Sandra just decided to follow us...

      "description": "MANILA, Philippines (AP) — About 725,000 people fled their homes and communities braced for heavy rain and coastal floods of up to 13 feet as Typhoon Melor slammed Monday into the eastern Philippines, officials said. Classes, flights and ferry trips were suspended.\n\nThe government's weather bureau said the typhoon was packing winds of 95 mph with gusts of up to 115 mph, and heavy to intense rain within its 185-mile diameter. It made landfall Monday morning on tiny Batag Island in the eastern Philippines, and a second landfall was expected in Sorsogon province.\n\nThe National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council said 724,839 residents of three eastern provinces were evacuated Sunday and early Monday before the storm's arrival.\nThe largest numbers of evacuees were in Sorsogon and Albay provinces.\n\nBernardo Alejandro, a regional civil defense official, said many residents of Sorsogon voluntarily went to shelters Sunday night, but the provincial governor then ordered evacuations Monday for residents who had refused to leave their homes despite the risk of floods and landslides.\nIn Albay, about 590,000 residents were evacuated as a precaution, including tens of thousands from around Mount Mayon volcano, where volcanic mudflows are an added threat, the national council said.\nEdgar Posadas, a civil defense official in the Eastern Visayas region, said parts of Allen town in Northern Samar province were flooded, and strong winds tore off roofs and felled coconut trees.\nHe said no casualties had been reported even in the northern tip of the province, where the typhoon first made landfall, and that the evacuation of residents and preparedness of local officials had so far proved effective.\nAbout 20 storms and typhoons hit the Philippines each year. In November 2013,Typhoon Haiyan, the strongest typhoon on record to make landfall, left more than 7,300 people dead and missing as it leveled entire villages and swept walls of seawater into parts of the central Philippines.",

      "description": "Pilipinas Bagyong, Lando Intensifies Further Interacts With New Typhoon\nMetro Manila (CNN Philippines) — Typhoon Lando intensified further as it threatened the provinces of Aurora, Isabela, and Northern Quezon on Saturday (October 17).\nIt was spotted 230 km east of Baler, Aurora, packing winds of 175 kph, as of 4 p.m.\nState weather bureau PAGASA's acting Director Espie Cayanan warned that Lando might stay longer in the Philippine area of responsibility (PAR) because it was interacting with Typhoon Champi, which was spotted outside the PAR.\n\"Habang hindi siya [Champi] tumataas at lumalayo, hindi makakagalaw si Lando,\" she said.\n[Translation: \"Lando won't be able to move away as long as (Champi) remains near it.\"]\nIt was likened to the weather conditions of 2009's Typhoon Pepeng, but PAGASA hoped it wouldn't be as devastating.\nThe rainfall was expected to be heavy to intense within the 650 kilometer diameter of the typhoon.\nLando is expected to make a landfall over Aurora area by Sunday morning (October 18).\nPossible storm surges may reach to a maximum of 3 meters in Aurora and neighboring provinces, with wave height in open sea may reach up to 14 meters or higher.\nThe National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) warned that Lando was turning out to be unlike previous ones.\n\"Hindi ito karaniwang bagyo, nakikita nating tatagal ito hanggang Martes (Oct. 20),\" Executive Director Alexander Pama said.\n[Translation: \"This is no ordinary typhoon, we expect it to remain here until Tuesday.\"]\nPama said that, as of early Saturday evening, provinces affected by the typhoon remained in manageable condition.\nIt is usually up to the local government units to decide when their constituents should leave their homes for safer grounds.\nHowever, in the coastal areas of Aurora, Cagayan and Isabela, the NDRRMC strongly advised local officials to carry out forced evacuations.\nPama said the government had over P94-million worth of food items in the areas affected by Lando.\nSource: http://cnnphilippines.com/news/2015/10/17/Typhoon-Lando-LandoPH-Champi-PAGASA.html",

      "description": "Typhoon Melor carved through the central Philippines on Tuesday, bringing heavy rain and strong winds that left millions without power and at least three people dead, officials said.\nOne person died of hypothermia while two others drowned in floods in the fishing town of Catarman in Northern Samar province in the Visayas region south of Manila, municipal disaster officer Jonathan Baldo told DZMM radio.\n\nThe storm toppled trees and cut electricity to at least seven provinces, the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) said.\n\nChristmas lanterns and lights, tin roofs and branches littered the streets of the city of Legazpi, which was battered by strong winds.\n\nPeople who fled from their coastal homes spent a sleepless night in evacuation centres, sprawled on classroom tables and chairs as flying debris swirled around outside.\nMelor whipped the vast Bicol peninsula, with a population of 5.4 million people, overnight before slamming into the Romblon islands on Tuesday morning.\n\nGusts had weakened somewhat by Tuesday morning but were still recorded at 170km (106 miles) per hour, from 185km per hour on Monday. The storm was expected to weaken further as it heads to Mindoro island and out into the South China Sea later Tuesday, state weather forecaster Aldczar Aurelio said.\n\nThere were no immediate reports of casualties in the typhoon-prone Bicol region, where 720,000 people were evacuated as early as the weekend.\n\n“We have zero floods, zero deaths, zero casualties,” Albay governor Joey Salceda told ABS-CBN television.\n\n“What we are asking for is the early restoration of electricity,” he said, adding the entire province of 1.2 million people was without power.\n\nAuthorities were assessing Melor’s damage while bracing for another typhoon brewing east of Mindanao, the country’s main southern island, said NDRRMC spokeswoman Mina Marasigan.",
